investing|Roth IRA Contributions and Advice|"Thank you in advance for your help.   
I am taking the year of 2024 off work and won't begin working until mid-2025. Is it true that I cannot contribute to a Roth IRA if I do not have a w2 income? If so, is there a loophole so I can contribute? I want to maximize my accounts and figured I would just invest in a brokerage account if there is nothing I can do. "|1.0|t3_18tuj3j|1703876426.0
investing|Trying to tilt for value/small cap, am I doing it right?|"29 year old, 100% of portfolio in equities 
20+ investment horizon 
Current planned allocation 
- 30% VOO
-30% AVUV
-30% VXUS
- 10% AVDV

Keep in mind I’m not from the US; i use a brokerage supported by IBK which charges fees per purchase (; so to minimize fees i try to;
- minimize number of ETFs (also for sake of simplicity) and
- stick to US based since it has lower fees (even if means losing out 30% of dividends) 

US stock fees 
USD 0.0199 per share minimum of 1.99 USD

Non US stock fees
0.199%, minimum of 19.9 EUR or GBP

Is it worth continuing to hold VPMAX or VPCCX, or would I be better off simply just dumping it all into VOO? I am young so there’s a long time horizon. The admiral funds and VOO [seem quite similar](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/portfolio-construction-tools/compare-products/result?selection=VPCCX,VPMAX,VTI,VOO), but it seems like past performance indicates that VOO is the better move.

investing|Can I get some input on my choice on pension investments?|"As the title says. After some deliberation, I have altered my default pension, a huge step I know. I'm not sure how that kind of thing is received on this sub, being only a very occasional visitor myself. On one hand I know you guys are experienced, even so, tampering with the pension feels like a massive step, even feeling relatively confident myself..

For background, my pension is with Aegon, 5% matched salary with my employer and i'm in the UK. I did the above for 2 reasons; firstly, it was horribly overweighted in bonds, too much for my liking at 32 years old. And I have the risk apetite to go equity heavy until a little later down the line. Secondly, it was a mixture of actively managed funds, this didn't have my confidence as from what i've read, the proportion of active managed beating index trackers over the long run are extremely low.

My new portfolio therefore looks like this: (apologies, I dont have the tikr and i'm too lazy to hunt at the moment)

Vanguard ESG developed world all-cap Index @86.6%

Vanguard ESG Emerging Markets index @10%

Vanguard global bond index fund hedged @3%

Cash (for account fees) @0.4%

My reasoning as I began touching on above is that I didnt like actively managed or bond heavy. Even Ray Dalio with his all weather fund has came out in recent times of high inflation and said that bonds are money losers in this climate. So an equity heavy bastardised 3 fund portfolio giving global diversification is what i've rested on.

Thoughts? Do you feel i'm over diversified? Would you include other asset classes or reweight the portfolio? Or do you feel i'd benefit more from another global equity for cheaper ongoing charges? I do realise the ESGs are approx 0.2% as opposed to other Vanguard funds. I do have other investment options outside of Vanguard, but most aren't as cheap. I feel this could be the fund or nearly the fund to carry my through the next 30 years, woth gradual reweighting in favour of bonds.

Thanks for your time guys

All the best for the new year"|0.67|t3_18tk5v6|1703845792.0

investing|‏Building a Diversified 20-Year Portfolio: Seeking Advice on ETFs and Growth Stocks|"Hey all ‏I'm looking to construct a secure portfolio over a 20-year period, incorporating a mix of ETFs and growth stocks. Any advice or recommendations for a balanced approach.

Furthermore, I welcome insights on the importance of asset diversification, whether it involves bonds, gold, or silver. Emphasizing a long-term perspective over 5 years or less, I lean towards index funds, but managing a large number of them can be overwhelming. Any advice on navigating this balance would be greatly appreciated.

I should note that over the past 5 years, I attempted random investments based on news and randomly picked stock names, but unfortunately, I struggled to outperform the market. I incurred losses amounting to nearly 40% of my initial capital. Seeking a more strategic approach moving forward.

The fact that it’s a decentralized human made virtual asset will (I think) likely become it’s downfall. 

It’s designed (by humans) and therefore it contains undiscovered errors/bugs/loopholes. The decentralized part will make this a more rigid system, less fast to update. Currently people are trying to find loopholes, but we can bet this will become superior computers that will outsmart humans. 

There are already serious possible threats towards the integrity of the network/wallets. Private key cracking is maybe the biggest one we can think of at the moment.

What will happen when (not if) the private keys of the largests wallets will be deciphered and used to transfer bitcoins? It will likely become its downfall.

For some reason a post here finally hit home and I liquidated all my risky single stock and ETF picks.  Seems like an OK time with market high.  I've thankfully been diversified with about 60% in SP500 and broad market (SWEGX SWPPX) throughout, and those have a nice 20%+ gain on them - all will be reinvested there, maybe some QQQ.  Meanwhile, nearly all my naïve stock and ETF picks (mostly solar, clean energy, battery, ARKK-cringe, trying to be an ethical investor and losing $$) are in the red.  

I can't predict the future, and I don't know how or have the time to do proper research on stocks!  I feel relatively confident clean energy will continue to grow, but I don't know how to pick the winners.  Time to sit back, relax, ride the market and stop throwing money away being stubborn.

* i max out rothIRA and 401k each year
*  in highest tax bracket
* have about $6k in a 529 plan
* i'm mid 40s
* no kids currently but maybe soon

...knowing that 529 plans will allow people to rollover $35k from 529 into a rothIRA starting in 2024, I had an idea...

is it a reasonable / sound strategy to front load that $35k into my 529 plan in an effort to put the money in the market to mature and essentially hedge my bets. IF I have a kid soon AND they wish to go to college that money is there for them OR if they choose not doing college (or other qualifying education) that money could be used for myself as a near-retired person for my own rothIRA, or used for the kid's own rothIRA.

1 misunderstanding i may have is if i'm retired and and the 18y/o isn't doing college and i don't have income outside of my rothIRA and 401k, could I still be funding my rothIRA? I feel like you have to have income in order to fund the rothIRA?  but may 401k and rothIRA withdrawals counts as income? :shruggie:

investing|What’s the best route for short term investing?|"I’m financially illiterate. I have a 401k through work and a Roth IRA with vanguard. I just have the target fund date. I’ve been working on saving for a down payment on a house. Roughly 17k just sitting in a savings account that I continue to add maybe 500 a month. Is there something beneficial I can be doing with that money that’s safe and short term. I’d imagine in 4 years I’ll use it for the house. But with inflation I feel like it’s just losing value. Im not smart enough to start choosing stocks but is there like an auto invest kind of account that can gain interest like the target fund date? Thanks for the direction

investing|Financial Advisor or not?|"I'm about to start working a 70k, W2 salary job, and will be making another 10-20k as a independent contractor under a LLC. My company will match me 2% max of my salary(or 25% of my contributions, whichever is lesser) for a 401k, so $5,600 a year is the max I want to contribute right now just to get the full match. 

I'll also be hopefully maxing my IRA, and will be choosing a HSA plan which I am 100% maxing out. 

My logic is to max out everything besides the 401k for the tax deductions and run any business expenses that qualify under my LLC to be as ""poor on paper"" as possible.

I plan to buy investment property of 80k-150k this year and just want to show the bare minimum taxable income I need to qualify for a mortgage. 

Do I need to hire a financial advisor for investing in retirement accounts? I'm trying to educate myself on YouTube about index funds, bond funds, etc, but don't want to make a huge mistake that I pay for in 30 years. But I also don't want a financial advisor doing the exact same thing I would have done and he/she just takes a fee from me every year. I don't even know if HSAs are opened in a bank, or if I just invest the money into the stock market.

I bought a house for $400,000 at a 6% interest rate. I will almost certainly sell in 3 years when I move because of my job. Should I pay extra to the principle each month or invest that money into my index funds in my brokerage account?

investing|Is my portfolio made by my wealth manager too complicated?|"I'm switching to vangaurd in the beggining of the year to avoid the 1% management fee and high expense ratios in my current investments (.38 average). I'm trying to copy my current portfolio, but it seems like VT + BND is the easiest way to go. 

My current portfolio is as follows:

* US Large Cap 40%
* International 20%
* US Mid cap 10%
* US Small Cap 10%
* Tax free municipals 5%
* other bonds 5%
* JEPI/Hedge funds 10%

These are further broken down into value and growth funds, ETFs and mutual funds, or long term, intermediate, and short term bonds, corporate v. goverment v. treasury bonds, as well as some sector investments. 

My protfolio has had great returns recently, so I wanted to replicate it, but after researching this site, it appears VT + BND is basicall all I need? Also, I don't see hedge funds as an option on vangaurd, or an S&amp;P weighted, or other funds I'm currently invested it, so it is hard to replicate in vangaurd.

investing|Car Wash Mogul- Enormous ROI|"Hi everyone,

So I was at my wife’s college reunion the other day and it was at her friend’s parent’s house. Needless to say I was blown away. It was easily 20,000 ft.², in the best part of town and clearly no expense was spared. The father is also building his daughter an 11,000 ft.² house down the road.

Why am I mentioning any of this? I asked my wife how he made his money and from what she knows, he sold his family-owned golf course for $9.4 million in 2006 and then bought three car washes (that also house car detailing and mechanic services) and has been on the up and up ever since. Factor in taxes etc and that would not come close to covering the cost of his lifestyle- trust me. Building the house easily cost $9m. With the exception of the golf course which his father picked up back in the day for peanuts, he and his family literally came from nothing, 900 sq ft housing a family of six- very blue collar. I realize that $9.4 million is an enormous amount of money but this guy lives like a guy worth $50m +. 

They travel only by private jet, stay in only five star hotels, and appear to have a bottomless pit of money. You get the idea.

Some quick math:

20,000 ft.² X 600 per sq ft = $12m built in 2015 (he paid cash for everything including purchase price)

11,000 ft.² X 600 per Sq ft = $6.6m in progress.

(He managed the construction of both houses and subbed everything out, so the cost was possibly substantially less than above figures)

$500k annual household budget (estimate)

Are there any car wash owners here or business owners who could offer their two cents on this enormous compounding of capital? Could this guy earn millions for himself every year from car washes? I looked up the company online and it says their revenues are $6.8 million. He could have invested everything in Facebook for all I know but from the background check I did it online looks like the car washes are his main assets. 

I know it’s very limited information. I can try to provide more information if I can. Thanks in advance"|0.34|t3_18t5xu9|1703801045.0
investing|$AVXL Anavex Alzheimer's Drug: A Timeline of Approval Prospects for 2024📅 Those following Anavex, would love to hear your expectations (or counterarguments) in comments!|"Anavex Life Sciences (AVXL) is developing a novel Alzheimer's drug called **Blarcamesine**. The company has made significant strides in the clinical development and is now seeking regulatory approval.  
  
**EU Approval**  
  
In November 2023, Anavex submitted a full approval application for Blarcamesine to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The EMA has recommended that Anavex proceed with this application earlier this month.  
  
The EU approval process is typically slower than the U.S. FDA approval process. However, the EMA has the potential to fast-track Blarcamesine due to its promising efficacy and safety profile.  
  
**U.S. FDA Approval**  
  
Anavex is also seeking accelerated approval for Blarcamesine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Accelerated approval is granted to drugs that show a positive effect on a surrogate biomarker, such as amyloid plaques or tau protein levels.  
  
In September 2023, Anavex announced that Blarcamesine had lowered the levels of amyloid plaques in the brain. The company also found that Blarcamesine slowed the loss of brain volume. Both findings were statistically significant.  
  
The FDA has granted accelerated approval to other Alzheimer's drugs based on biomarker data alone. Therefore, it is possible that the FDA could grant accelerated approval to Blarcamesine.  
  
**Timeline**  
  
Anavex has not set a specific release date for Blarcamesine. However, the company has indicated it expects the drug could be approved in 2024. Here is a possible timeline for Blarcamesine approval:  
  
**EU Approval: Early 2024**  
**U.S. FDA Accelerated Approval: Spring or summer 2024**  
**U.S. FDA Regular Approval: Late 2024 or early 2025**  
  
**Conclusion**  
  
Anavex's Alzheimer's drug has the potential to be a major breakthrough in the treatment of this debilitating disease. The company is making progress in the clinical development and regulatory approval process. If all goes well Blarcamesine could be available to patients in 2024 🤞🤞🤞  
  
**Additional Considerations**  
  
Blarcamesine seems to be more effective than Leqembi, the only other Alzheimer's drug approved in the past decade (developed by Biogen). Blarcamesine seems to be much safer than Leqembi, since there have been no deaths caused by Blarcamesine.  


The global Alzheimer's market is estimated to be worth over **$40B** annually.  
  
**DISCLAIMER**  
  
Long **AVXL Anavex** (potential promising treatment) and **BIIB Biogen** (approved drug but has severe side effects). This is **NOT** investment advice. Please do your own DD before making any investment decisions."|0.81|t3_18t3z1z|1703796135.0

investing|Should I focus on my Roth IRA or my 403b?|"Public employee here. For context, I am just under 30 years old, annual income around $80,000, and no debt/loans/substantial monthly payments.

The state offers a healthy pension that will give a great monthly income into retirement, but I like to prepare as if that pension (as well as social security) won't be there when I retire in 30+ years.

I have both a 403b (current balance is around $15K) and a Roth IRA (current balance of $80,000). Additionally, I've got a single account with $140,000, plus miscellaneous savings/checking accounts. 

I've been maxing out my Roth IRA since I was 19, and I picked up the 403b when I started my job, just putting a hundred bucks or so into it each month.

My question: should I be shifting more money into my 403b vs. the Roth IRA? I struggle with balancing saving for the future while also allowing myself to live today, so I'd like to keep my total monthly investments roughly where they are (around $700 or $800 per month). Any advice on where it is best to put those dollars each month is appreciated.

The tracking error for BNDW is listed at 1.97 on Fidelity, while BND has a tracking error of .25 and BNDX has a tracking error of 4.02. Does this seem accurate and if so, what gives? Is this a cause for concern?  
I'd also be interested in similar funds to BNDW. I was looking at FXNAX, which has a great expense ratio, but I'd prefer a global fund."|0.25|t3_18t2fk2|1703792145.0

investing|Question about taking profits|"Hi, I own 37.859 shares of SWIPPX, I'm up $734.94, which is +36.04% on my initial investment. I initially bought into this mutual fund with the intention of selling at $1k so I could buy myself a new bicycle, which I think I am going to do this summer. I've been thinking lately that it makes sense to cash out the profit on this, and let it keep growing, if I earn an additional $300 that's great, it gets me to my goal. I've read different things about taking profits etc, but most of it involves this 20-25% rule, or it applies to stocks, or it takes into account other mathematical factors. Anything more than basic arithmetic confuses me - I can do it, but I kind of need someone to explain it to me like I'm five!

Is there a general rule of thumb when it comes to taking profits in a situation like this, or with an index fund etc? Does it make sense for me to cash out the $734.94, locking in that profit, and then cashing out when it goes up another $300? I've held this position for over a year, so I'll pay the lower capital gains on it.

investing|Are International ETFs worth it given tax drag?|"I am Just getting started on self-investing and I would like to include international exposure to my portfolio because of diversification and return benefits. However, I don't know if the tax implications would outweigh the possible benefits.  
Based on what I have read, in a taxable account, foreign tax withholding is offset by a tax credit, but international ETFs often have more non-qualified dividends which are taxed at the income tax rate. However in a tax-advantaged account, the dividends don't matter but the foreign tax cannot be recovered/offset.  
Given these tax drags, does it make sense to invest internationally at all? I guess for lower-income investors whose income tax rates are low wouldn't be too affected by ordinary dividends in a taxable account. What about for mid to high income investors?

investing|The NYTs is suing Microsoft and I think there is a profitability play on their stocks|"What Happened
Headlines yesterday were championed by the largest copyright lawsuit in the Manhattan Federal Court: The New York Times sues Microsoft and OpenAI. The copyright infringement lawsuit against the companies says that both used the newspaper’s content to train their models without permission. In doing so, the companies jeopardized Time’s business in its entirety. The Times also suggested in the filing that both companies should be liable for BILLIONS of damages. What prompted the lawsuit? Failed negotiations between the involved parties over the usage of Times material. They also stated they were worried about AI attributing false information to the newspaper. I guess when money is on the line news outlets decide to worry about whether their information is accurate or not. Now here is the real kicker - the Times is calling for both OpenAI and Microsoft to destroy all chatbots that use Times material. With OpenAI’s valuation, currently over $80 bn, coming almost completely from ChatGPT, this could compromise the integrity of the entire company. 

The Simple Sides (My) Take
The bad news is that I am not a legal professional and truly have no idea how this will go. While I do hold my own opinions, I have reached out to multiple lawyers to get more professional opinions and will be sure to add them here when they respond. In the meantime let’s jump into a couple of completely feasible outcomes. 

The entire lawsuit is kaput: a.k.a, insignificant or thrown out 
To me, this lawsuit is somewhat of a joke: “Newspaper upset that companies use articles available online.” I honestly DO NOT think the lawsuit will amount to much. It seems like journalists at the Times are worried that they are going to lose money and jobs to AI and aren’t happy about it - rightfully so. However, being scared and upset about AI replacing you isn’t a good reason to cry out to the long arm of the law. When the case gets underway it will be interesting to see the arguments presented by the legal team for the Times. 

The New York Times wins the lawsuit
If the Times wins the lawsuit it could be a major step in journalism’s fight against AI. Not only would the victory set a legal precedent for future AI copyright cases, but it would mean significant damages being paid to the Times. They (the Times) could come into billions of dollars, possibly boosting the stock (ticker: NYT) to 52-week highs. This could also lead to a revaluation of the AI industry. If websites can “charge” for AI models training on their information, the profitability scales might shift. The more content you have online the more you could capitalize on AI models. AI companies are also not heavily regulated at the moment. A win for the Times could shift lawmakers’ attention to the growing market sector.

Microsoft and OpenAI win the lawsuit 
Similar to if the Times won, there would be a legal precedent set - AI models can be trained on any information. This could also reinforce the current AI industry and lead to possible growth in valuations for AI-invested stocks. The New York Times would also likely experience some negative effects, possibly paying lawyer fees for both defendants. In layman’s terms, Microsoft stock would be soaring up and the New York Times would be diving down. 

Stock Movements Based on Lawsuit Outcomes
We see the MSFT and NYT stocks moving in all sorts of directions depending on the outcome of the pending lawsuit. No need to worry, you’re reading The Simple Side, so we’re gonna break it down for you. If nothing happens and the lawsuit is thrown out then Microsoft might suffer some residual damage from the negative headlines, but the stock price will remain relatively steady. If the New York Times wins then its stock will likely jump up probably both in the short and mid-term, but Microsoft will likely have a significant short-term drop. If Microsoft wins then its stock will jump in both the short and mid-to-long-term, whereas the Times stock will drop in the short term and likely recover within the mid-term.

Could capitalize using options trade strategies. I wrote a full article about this and the profitability of the trades but out of respect for the “no promotion” sub guidelines I can’t post links. GOOD LUCK OUT THERE INVESTORS!"|0.48|t3_18t0ss4|1703788020.0
investing|I'm having a hard time understanding how ETFs expenses work|"I'm wondering if anyone can shed light on this.

So I understand ETF's have expense ratios that are expressed as a percentage, and I understand that is the expense the ETF provider charges annually. I also understand that this expense is fractionally deducted from the fund's Net Asset Value daily. However, I don't understand how the NAV is consolidated with the share price.

For example, QQQ and QQQM follow the exact same basket of stocks (NASDAQ 100) but one has an expense ratio of 0.2% while the second has an expense ratio of 0.15%. Wouldn't this imply that QQQM would always have a higher NAV than QQQ? How does Invesco ensure the prices don't diverge endlessly? How do they both always have the same returns as the NASDAQ 100 if their NAV is continuously diverging?

investing|My options contract is about to expire, I'm in over my head. What should I do?|"Hi all! So I wanted to start trying to understand how options work so I bought 1 contract. Turns out that's not a good way to go about understanding it. Anyway, looking for advice on what to do and what choices I have. I tried googling but am having trouble understanding and getting the answers I'm looking for.


Here are some of the facts as I know them:

 
In July 2023 I bought 1 contract of 100 shares for $100 (so $1 a share). At the time, the price per share was around $35.

What I had bought is a ""call"" contract with the strike price being $80 (breakeven $81 per robinhood) with the expiration on Jan 19th 2024.  


By some miracle, the stock is now $83 a share. 

Given that the expiration is close (and it looks like I'm making money now) I'm unsure what to do or how to move forward.  My understanding is I can even act on some of those choices now? And that my options are to ""sell"" or ""exercise"". I'm having trouble understanding what each of these mean. 


Please correct me if I'm wrong!! 

So far, I THINK ""sell"" is just sell the contract for what it's worth currently to someone else that believes it will do even better by the date.

 I think ""exercise"" means that I can make the contract give me the 100 shares without paying any extra (because i bought the 100 shares for $100 in the contract?) because it is at/above the strike price of $80. I am very nervous that if I click ""exercise"" that i will be signing up to buy 100 shares at the $80 price, thus spending $8000 in addition to the $100 i spent buying the contract. Also, if the stock was selling below $80, my understanding is I wouldn't be given the option to ""exercise"".

investing|I have a Vanguard Brokerage account, and just opened a Roth IRA. Should I transfer the funds to max out my Roth IRA?|"Hi and thank you for your interest in my post.

As the title mentions, I recently opened a Roth IRA using Vanguard. I have been investing in VTSAX for several years with Vanguard, with a single brokerage account, which I am now learning is a (correct me if I'm wrong) taxable brokerage account. 

With the newly opened Roth IRA I had the option of contributing to it using the funds from my original brokerage account, but I did a little research before submitting, it seems like that would be a mistake. If I'm understanding this correctly, this would mean Vanguard will sell my funds to supplement the transaction to my Roth IRA. Is this what is called a wash sale? Would it be more optimal to supplement the Roth Ira with my current yearly earnings?

TL;DR: Have Vanguard brokerage account w/ VTSAX, just opened Roth IRA. Should I fund the IRA with current investments or available earnings? Is this the definition of a wash sale?

Thank you for any insight you may be able to provide me!"|0.5|t3_18snj57|1703746208.0

We will get married in May of 2024. She makes about 200k before taxes, I make about 50k. After 2023, we will no longer be able to contribute to a Roth IRA given our combined income. Neither of us have a Roth IRA currently. We have the money on hand to dump the yearly max for 2023 into one for each of us.

My question: Given that we will likely put the $6500 in and never contribute again after 2023, is this still a fine investment, or should we consider a different option?

investing|How to track my actual portfolio performance?|"Hey folks, tech question here. I have a bunch of equities held in Schwab and I would like to track the actual performance of my portfolio over time compared to various indexes. However, there appear to be several elements of actual return that are not accounted for in Schwab's ""performance"" calculations: 

1. Cash flows in or out of the account 
2. Dividends 
3. Fees (such as ADR mgmt fees)
4. Taxes (such as foreign taxes when investing in ADRs) 

From research in this sub, seems like Modified Dietz is the traditional approach to being able to see return. Is there a platform that I can connect Schwab to that will do this for me? I tried SigFig but don't see how this will actually solve the problem.

investing|Return on Net Tangible Assets Usage|"Hi all,

  
Had a quick question that I wanted to run by the group. I've been building together a checklist for evaluating new stocks and one metric that I've been mulling over the last few days is Return on Net Tangible Assets (RONTA). There isn't a whole lot of coverage on this metric and when there is, the equations differ (some just take out intangible assets and goodwill from total assets and subtract from total liabilities, while others also take out interest bearing liabilities).

  
Does anyone look at this metric when evaluating new companies? While obviously you would need to benchmark this % against comparable companies/industries, I'm having a hard time interpreting it in the sense that the metric doesn't seem really useful for tech companies where goodwill/intangibles are a large % of total assets and would thus have an inflated percentage. Maybe it would be useful just for financial/manufacturing/etc. companies?

  
Also, when I look at a company like $DGX who is in healthcare, their RONTA % is 30-40%, which seems pretty good, but then I'm not sure it makes sense to take out goodwill since they have been growing mostly through acquisitions. So, would ROA % be better for them?

  
I guess I'm looking at ROA %, Operating ROA % (using EBIT) and RONTA % and wondering how and when I should be using each metric for company evaluation."|0.5|t3_18sdt8z|1703717791.0

If I start now and DCA $50/week into an ETF which manages a 7% return, that totals $83k from the $44k in deposits.

investing|Stay in and grow further vs Get out asap|"
Tldr: will have just enough next year to make a down payment for a house, uncertain if that's the smart decision, or if it's best to save further so net value doesn't go to near zero. 

44M, wife and a 5yr old son, living in a rented house in Europe (Portugal). Net worth around 80k euros, 70k in the market (100% stocks), the rest in a bank account, for day to day + any unexpected needs.

While maintaining our standards of life, I expect to be able to add around 35k to investment account in 2024, and between 15 to 20k a year from 2025 onwards (I will take a sort of pay cut in 2025 as some temporary tax breaks will end). 

Life Goals:
	- Buy a house in Lisbon (to live in now, and leave it to my son in the future) 
	- Buy a house in Madeira (to live in after retirement) 
	- Retire around 60-65
	
Currently losing sleep over the following:
Get to 100k euros and make a down payment for an apartment in Lisbon in mid 2024
 OR 
stay invested and living in a rental until reaching 200k euros (in 4 years or less, hopefully), and then take 100k out to make the down payment?

I am dreading having to start the investments from zero again. Bought my first stock in 2020, made huge mistakes in 2021 and 22 (didn't sell , rode from the top all the way down until near oblivion, bought options, took out personal credit, etc) and then gained some sense in 2023, and will end this year at around +30%. Also, I'm now 100% debt free.

On the other hand, the market taking another downturn is scary as well, even though I'm convinced we'll have years of positive returns ahead of us, with the interest rates going down (which should also help with more accessible housing prices...) 

Anyone facing similar dilemma? In general, is it smart to get out of the market and essentially start over when you reach just enough for a goal of yours, or stay in until there's still some capital left to grow?

investing|What I'm watching in premarket 27/12 including my analysis on DXY and Small caps.|"  
**Analysis: Looking at Dollar &amp; Small Caps:**  
**DOLLAR:**  


* DXY is now down 3% since the Dec 13th Fed meeting, and 5% down since November, on rate cut optimism. Let’s look at what the data is telling us about what traders are expecting going forward now. 
* If we compare the CDX to DXY, we can see that Corporate bond traders expect the dollar to continue to fall from here. (See the analog below. DXY tends to track CDX)
   * [https://imgur.com/a/fYBFuvz](https://imgur.com/a/fYBFuvz)
* The bloomberg risk reversal index also just hit the low of the year. This also tells us that the dollar is expected to remain under pressure. 
   * [https://imgur.com/a/jSD1jAr](https://imgur.com/a/jSD1jAr)   
* Conclusion: Dollar to remain under pressure. This is positive for the equity markets. A falling dollar should continue to support equity markets higher.   


**Small Caps:**  


* Since October, Small caps have rallied as investors rotate out of Mag 7. 
* If we track the IWM against SPY (Small caps vs Big caps), we can see that the IWM is testing the resistance of a medium term downtrend. 
   * [https://imgur.com/a/bHZH7J2](https://imgur.com/a/bHZH7J2)   
* What this tells us is that we could see some short term correction in small cap stocks, many of which have rallied significantly. 
* This is what the Skew Data is telling us too. IV in OTM call options has reduced, and there is a gamma resistance at 105 on IWM. 
* All of this tells us that we could see some price correction in IWM soon.
* However, long term the momentum is still strong for small caps. Flows into corporate bonds remain supportive.

**What happened yesterday and what are my thoughts on it?**  


* Boxing Day is historically the 2nd best trading day of the year, with average returns of 0.5%. Yesterday’s returns was 0.42%.
* SPX opened around 4761, before moving higher. Intraday, it moved above the 4775 level, which has formed a resistance throughout last week. Couldn't break notably above it, so will continue to watch this level today. This was likely due to lack of data and volume in the market. Ultimately, sellers were sitting at this level. 
* The drop in dollar as well as seasonal boost is what supported market yesterday. 
* Oil outperformed on falling dollar and as US bought 3 million barrels for their strategic reserve. 
* Nio popped after unveiling new sedan, whilst Intel dragged other semis higher after securing funding for new project in Israel  


**——— INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH ———**   


* ANZ - USDJPY will eventually move lower to 136 by the end of 2024
* ANZ sees AUD/USD at 0.68 in Q1 and 0.7 in Q4. Driven by USD drop and developments in China. RBA will only cut at end of 2024, whilst Fed would start cutting before. Also risk positive sentiment. 
* BBH says they expect Dollar to remain under pressure this week. Lack of any major data to slow downward momentum. 
* BCA research compared historic relationship between bank lending standards and commercial and industrial loans. Suggested that history tells us commercial and industrial loans will be down 10% by H2 2024. Said this only happens in recessions.

investing|Investing vs. Sports Gambling|"Hi all - kind of a silly question here but I was thinking, one of the allures of sports betting is that you can have a realistic shot (say a 40% chance) of doubling your money in one night if you pick a game right.

Investing in the S&amp;P 500 for example gives you a much better chance at doubling your money but it might take ~10 years.  

Is there a way to essentially “gamble” in the market on a short term time basis where the upside is potentially doubling your money, the outcome of your “bet” is realized much more quickly and you have say at least a 40% chance of “winning”? 

Not really interested in penny stocks and haven’t explored Puts much.  Thanks!

Edit: I should have noted, I’m not suggesting this as a strategy for wealth building.  More just a potential outlet for “fun”, discretionary spending in the same way sports gambling can be entertaining if done responsibly.

My VA Disability will likely be for life &amp; as long as the govt doesn't fail I'll likely be able to utilize my VA as essentially ""Retirement"". I'm more concerned about providing for my wife's security &amp; kids. 

Ive contributed a bit to 401k this year, it's negligible at the moment but there is match. Do we start maxing out Roth IRA? I don't necessarily trust 401k, I'm in a profession where I have seen peoples 401k wiped out. Our total debts/bills equal about $5,500 monthly. $2500 Mortgage, $3 000 total with Utilities etc. 2 Car Payments equal to $900 &amp; then additional house hold payments/ expenses. Debt is minimal, about 12k on a debt consolidation &amp; 4k on a low interest Platinum Credit Card (8%)

We reliably bring home $11,000-$11,500 monthly. We are in the 1st half of our 30's. I'm also in a profession where I have an advantage in purchasing Real Estate &amp; want to make my first investor purchase this year if possible. Our goal currently I think is to have 5-6 Rentals &amp; have them paid off or down by the time we want to retire in 20-25 Years, prior to social security (if it's still available) I think I'd rather bank on Real Property &amp; appreciation over time. 

What are your thoughts? Who would you turn to for financial advice? What would you do?

Just to note. VA Disability is not taxed and not counted as income to my knowledge for investing purposes such as ROTH IRA."|0.41|t3_18ryu3x|1703677252.0

investing|Missed the 2023 stock market rally because of a large focus on bonds|"I've been primarily holding bonds this entire year and having practically all of my recurring investments go towards t-bills as I was excited about a guaranteed 5%+. I sort of got burned in 2022 in the market so I had started to allocate much of my portfolios in bonds and rarely looked at the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

investing|[Advice] MetLife vs pure S&amp;P500, SPY, w/e investment|"Hello everyone,

Four years back, I got ""lured"" into doing some insurance(?) at MetLife where I invest 400$ a month and they manage this, some kind of investment, not entirely sure of the details as I don't have the policy right in front of me.

I have had regular yearly meetings with representatives discussing details, perforamnce, etc.

Last year, when they showed me the performance it was like -10% or so.

Now, after started investing there it sparked my interest so I did some reading and created a portfolio of my own (not huge, but of about 50k$) and managed to get a return of 114.7% to date (i.e. roughly 2 years). I have mostly been doing swing trading in the TechStock market as I work in the field of IT.

That being said, understanding more or less how the markets work, it seems that investing in an ETF myself would be way better than MetLife handling any of my money (not only do they manage to underpofrm against the market, but also take some fee).

The money I put there are solely for my kids so I don't really want to do any kind of trading with them as I have a long period span of 18+ years to invest and wait.

  
**TLDR**: Started inveting in MetLife, they seem to underpform disasterously and I think to start investing into an ETF myself as I have gained some experience the past few years.

**The Question:** I want to start investing these 400$ a month ( as I curently have the option to opt out of investing in MetLife without any fee) as well as money coming from relatives for birthdays, Christmas, etc. (we get the kids enough presents anyway and I think we are doing rather well with income for Europe) into S&amp;P500. What would you all advise me to do: Keep the MetLife investment or start my own portfolio?

investing|What should I invest $100k in?|"Hello all,

I've got a rental house that I've had for a couple years which on paper is an amazing investment.

Sadly although I have a management company running it it is far more psychologically trying than I originally thought. Surprisingly renting your house that you once loved to a terrible person that calls it a shit hole and complains about everything takes a toll emotionally even if you don't have to deal with it. Your mind always goes back to the house which is something I did not anticipate 

If I cashed out I'd get about 100k in proceeds. What would be a good investment for this money? I'd really like something that prioritizes an income generating component over growth. I know if I put it away in a mutual fund until I retire it will be worth a lot more. What I am learning in life though is that ""golden years"" aren't that golden and the government will take everything anyway when you can't afford a shit nursing home bed for $5k a month and you have to go on welfare.

Treat them as just one data point among many.

* A year that investors don't have to be afraid because so many things are improving. The main thing is that the Fed won't be fighting an inflation war. We are also in an earnings recovery cycle (earnings bottomed in the 3rd quarter)
* Bullish on small caps for 2024. Number one pick is the IWM
* 10-year treasury has a lot of room to come down in 2024. Brings down mortgage rates. This means being invested in groups that are sensitive to falling interest rates (e.g. interest rates and financials) and improving housing
* Number one large cap sector pick: financials, industrials, and technology
* Capex recovery next year because surveys show everyone was too cautious this year
* Back-end loaded year in 2024. More money made in second half. Base case is the S&amp;P is flat or down 5% in the first half. There's likely going to be a growth scare in the first half (anxiety from the start of rate hikes)

Coming to my question: Is there a good website/way to see all upcoming issuances at least a few weeks in advance?

I live in a state without state income tax, and our state’s 529 plan isn’t anything special.

Morning Star absolutely loves Utah’s 529 plan but the Fidelity UNIQUE plan scores quite averagely. Any glaring red flags that I haven’t seen in UNIQUE?

All my other investment accounts are with Fidelity so I value having all my accounts in one place. Not sure who backs Utah529 but I trust Fidelity a lot and have a strong history with them.

I also value low fees and from my research they both seem on par as far as that goes, but would love someone who has invested in either to let me know what their experience has been.

Me, with a few days left in the year have underperformed the S&amp;P by about 10 basis points.  I was down bad early in the year based on a large underweight to the magnificent seven and a large merger arbitrage bet that went sour.  I was also in an out of the benchmark position in pimco California municipal bond cefs which took a hit when Pimco out of nowhere cut distributions and prices tanked.  

I made a lot of changes to my portfolio this year eliminating all bonds and going 100% stocks as this is a taxable account.  I put all the bonds in my IRAs.  

I was also heavily overweighted to dividend stocks at the beginning of the year which contributed to my underperformance.  I dumped some of those and lowered allocations to others which allowed me to substantially increase my allocation to tech and the mag 7.  I still am underweight the mag 7, especially apple but am overweight certain software stocks and semiconductor stocks.   Making these changes allowed me to catch up to the index by the end of the year after being down close to 600 basis points at the halfway point."|0.64|t3_18qzpik|1703565036.0

investing|Diversifying into INDA: Balancing Growth and Risks in Global Markets|"I'm an investor from Europe, currently diversified into BET (Romania) and SXR8 (S&amp;P500), exploring further diversification options. While I appreciate the stability and growth potential in my current portfolio, there are some concerns I'd like your opinions on.

For the US (SXR8), my concerns are about the aging population potentially impacting the consumer base and workforce, political instability, and the looming US-China tensions in the Pacific. However, the US's leadership in tech and AI innovation is a strong positive.

In Romania (BET), much like the rest of Europe, there's been a surge in support for fringe parties. While political and fiscal challenges persist, Romania's potential entry into Schengen in the next few years could significantly boost the economy. The war in Ukraine presents risks and opportunities, especially in terms of post-war reconstruction.

Now, I'm considering INDA (iShares MSCI India ETF). India's burgeoning young population and rapid economic growth are appealing, yet I'm still evaluating the risks and opportunities here.What are your thoughts on adding INDA to my portfolio for further diversification? How do you view the balance of risks and growth prospects in the Indian market compared to the US and Romanian markets?

Looking forward to your insights.

So currently my work has an Employee Stock Purchasing Plan with a 15% match, and as a result I have been consistently contributing into that. I have recently moved my shares into my own private Fidelity brokerage account. I’m a young college student so it is not an insane amount of money, but it is about $4,500 so it’s still a significant amount to me at this stage of my life. My question is whether I should keep the stocks or reallocate them? 
I was always told to not have “all your eggs in one basket” so having the money all in one stock (it’s a blue retail company) doesn’t seem like the best strategy to me. I’ve thought about it and I could sell my shares and by a ETF like VOO or VTI, I could buy a company with a higher dividend, or I could put the money into a Roth-IRA. 

I’m at the pivotal moment of graduating next semester, so while I know that the Roth is probably the best call for me long term I know that I cannot withdrawal for a substantial time. It would nice to be able to have access to the funds in the case of an emergency and I suppose that I could put it in a HYSA, however I know that the market growth in average is much higher.

Additionally I’m not sure if selling is the best idea because I know I’ll have to pay taxes on the gains, but I’ll be honest I’m not entirely sure about the specifics of that.

investing|What are your predictions for 2024?|"2023 was nothing if not confusing. Rates climbed by a percent, but somehow the market went up by 20%, with several tech stocks blowing well past that. The market is pricing in major rate drops next year which is even more bullish, but the economy doesn’t quite feel “better” from a consumer perspective - the uselessness of the CPI has been debated ad nauseam. 

With 2023 drawing to a close, I’m curious what everyone’s theses are for 2024. I feel like real estate will remain depressed since rate drops will incentivize higher prices, and supply hasn’t fully recovered, but I don’t think the cost of debt is going to be affordable, so really kind of a stalemate.

I have zero experience with this sort of thing - how does it usually go? Do these lawsuits ever go anywhere? is it worth joining the class actions? does it matter which of the several different law firms I sign up with?"|0.53|t3_18pywws|1703436759.0
investing|Why not use index future /ES for leverage instead of a margin loan for holding 2x SPY?|"I doubled my returns when the interest rates were 0% by leveraging 2x using margin loans. Those margin loans are quite expensive these days with IB at 6% rate.  It looks like I can leverage 2x easily by longing /ES future contracts and keep rolling them over before expiration. And I don't have to pay any interest for this leverage. It almost sounds too good to be true. What am I missing here? I know leverage is a double edge sword and I never exceed 2x even though you can easily leverage 18x or more with futures contracts.

It also seems like I can earn interest on the cash that is not invested in SPY.  Say if I wanted to invest $240k in SPY, I mean I need to lock up all $240k by buying SPY. But instead I can invest all that cash in T Bills and buy one /ES contract if I have portfolio margin. That gives me exposure to S&amp;P 500 while earning 5% on treasuries. So why would anyone buy SPY then? They could just invest in /ES or /MES and free up cash and invest in money market or treasuries."|0.86|t3_18pyqeq|1703436179.0

investing|Employee Stock Purchase Plan - How Rapidly Can Shares be Sold through Fidelity?|"I'm not sure whether this can be answered, but here goes anyway.  My wife has an ESPP for the first time.  Her first six-month purchase period concludes this Friday, 12/29, and then the shares will be automatically purchased that day (managed by Fidelity).  The company's stock price tends to bounce up and down a lot, but as of today, it is up 7% versus the beginning of the purchase period.  The shares will be purchased with a 15% discount on the share price at the beginning of the six months since that price is the lower of the beginning and end of the six months (unless there is a big drop this week, of course).  So we should make a nice profit beyond the 15% assuming there is no major drop.

There is no mandatory holding period for the shares purchased.  Because the stock price does bounce up and down pretty substantially from day-to-day, I would like to go ahead and sell on Friday if the price is up.  Is that even possible?  Would Fidelity process the stock purchase quickly enough for us to be able to go ahead and sell almost instantly on the same day?  Just asking in case anyone else has experience with an ESPP managed through Fidelity.  It's obviously not the end of the world if the stock price drops between Friday, 12/29, and Tuesday, 1/2, but why lose out on even $50 to $100 profit if we can avoid it!"|0.69|t3_18pwadg|1703428261.0

investing|REITs vs SP500 vs dividend delusion|"I always had this logic if I invest long enough into Reits I would be able to retire with dividends wiithout withdrawing.

Lots of people say once snowball begins you really feel the power of dividends.

I have another 35 years before retirement anyway and residency is UK but more and more doing calculations of profit after each year finish I realise dividends is like fake hope. For example first year my dividends payout was £16.43. This year is £900 range and next year projected £1400 which seems good on paper but these very dividends stock could have been replaced with growth and instead of small realized gains I would of had way more unrealised gains.

But more on reits there is even research that Reits most years outperform SP500 due to the power of reinvesting dividends but after holding
Vici (risk but growth) Realty Income (passive but monthly dividend and super diversified) I realised they are both very passive boring stocks both together are 15% of my portfolio.

Of course during high interest rates you wouldnt expect Reits to be exciting but I just did future conservative calculations and slightly doubt whether its even worth holding Reits. Posting here whether I missed something from my calculations that makes it so one sided

Like the way I see snowball effect is when it's growth is  exponential and I thought if for example Realty Income pays you £45 per month that would be enough to buy 1 whole share right  so calculations are you need 264 shares which is £11,880


Year 1 
264 shares +£45 dividend monthly
Month 1 
264+45
Month 2
265+45.05
Month 3
266+45.22

Month 8
271+46.07
Month 9
272+46.24
Month 10
273 +46.41
Month 11
274 +46.58
Month 12
275 +46.75

1 year from 
264 shares =11,880

To
11,880 +3% annual growth =12,236
+reinvested shares 11 =495
=12,731
7.2% growth

But if invested in growth stock 
11,880 +20%
1 year =14,256


So I thought snowball effect doesn't really happen with 11k into Reits but what if I was able to buy 4 Realty Income shares every month is that snowball effect?


£57,000 = 1266 shares
=£215.22 per month gives you 4.7 shares at current price

Year 1
1266 shares +£215 dividend monthly
Month 1
1266+215

If invested in VUSA
10% annual growth
57000+10% =62700
Plus dividends £772 per year
63,475
11.5% growth

Only reason I chose Realty Income is because it's extremely safe stable diversified stock pays 5% but even with 60k invested I still don't see snowball effect of course everyone says just put it into VUSA and forget but dividend investors talk about how they can outperform sp500 but I don't see whether its even worth trying 

Maybe in your last 5 years employed you start exchanging your growth stocks and ETFs for Reits for passive Income but slowly I realized recently, investing into passive dividend stocks while young is a big waste of time and illusion to provide passive Income that isn't there. You can compare year 1 dividends received to current year and say wow snowball effect is real but when you take into consideration on how much growth you missed out. Makes me feel my investing strategy has been used 30 years too early 

Even when my portfolio consist of 55% Apple &amp; MSFT just mistakes like TROW DIS SOFI my portfolio every year for 5 years is 3-7% lower than VUSA. Even though stock picking is fun but it really is true VUSA seems the only hassle-stress free strategy. Don't need to readjust anything, don't need to check earnings and new competitors or sales it's so simple. Anyone else had these realizations and just want to sell everything and buy VUSA and relax with DRIP? Or do you keep believing

I just opened one, and want to fill it with the $6,500 limit for this year. I have an account on Fidelity. I’ve done a bunch of research, but I have a hard time making decisions regarding which funds, what percentage, etc. I know I want balanced risk, and I want it to be index funds if possible, and diversified well. Nothing fancy. (For context, I'm in my 30s. have good savings, have a 401k at work, and some ibonds and CDs, in addition to this.)

I spoke with a Fidelity advisor. He showed me the ETF Portfolio Builder tool that they have on their site, and recommended I use it. Using the tool, I put in the amount I’m investing, which at this time is the full $6,500, since I didn’t do it earlier in the year. For investment objective, I selected “Growth”. You can then choose a “Model Type”, which is “Fidelity-only”, or “ iShares &amp; Fidelity”.

Initially, I selected the Fidelity-only model. I’m attaching a screenshot of their breakdown recommendation. [Screenshot 1](https://imgur.com/eEdYjxi) and [screenshot 2](https://imgur.com/epQEMTQ). I’d noticed that there weren’t any index funds in the breakdown. I guess because Fidelity doesn’t have a Fidelity-specific ETF index fund? What do you think about the breakdown?

I then selected the iShares &amp; Fidelity model. That one did give me an index option. [Screenshot 1](https://imgur.com/Pi2st78) and [screenshot 2](https://imgur.com/roE52DP). So, is there much of a difference between selecting that iShare index vs. say, Vanguard or other? And what do you think about that breakdown vs the Fidelity-only one?

I cannot seem to find a broad based commodity etf listed in CAD that will give me exposure to all commodities.

XBM / XMA exposure - diversified metals and mining, copper, aluminum, gold, silver, forest products, steel. 

COW exposure - general ag, fertilizers, industrials, ag finance 

XEG - Canadian oil and gas

Questions are, 

* Will these choices together give me the broadest commodity exposure possible with ETF investing in CAD dollars. 

* Am I missing any other obvious choices ? Or will these together encapsulate the most broad market commodity trends ? 

* Due to the high number of gold mining exposure that 2 of these ETFs posses will it give me the same result as investing in gold as a inflation and market crash hedge.

investing|The biggest lesson that I've learned in my 10 year investing career.|"Why do companies like $WMT $COST $AMZN and $MSFT just keep on outperforming over time?

Culture.

They are perpetual innovation machines.

Sometimes, their culture goes astray but eventually it gets fixed.

When culture goes south, the company goes south.

When it gets fixed, the company goes back to doing well.

Culture is a result of a series of excellent organizational properties.

All companies that I own that have an excellent culture (which again, is a condensation of many aspects) just continue doing well.

Those that do not, eventually turn into losers.

Take $MSFT for instance.

The stock was flat from the year 2000 to the year 2014.

Why? Because Steve Ballmer operated a culture that sucked.

High in politics, low in innovation.

People were scared to fail, so no one shared ideas.

Good news moved fast around the company. Bad news, not so much.

Then came Satya and totally transformed the culture.

$MSFT shifted to being low in politics, high in meritocracy.

High in individual courage. Courage to innovate, share ideas and fail over and over until success comes.

investing|Keeping 401k vs Rolling over every year to Roth IRA|"Hihi

I am seeking advice on why you should keep money in 401k plan vs rolling it over periodically into a Roth IRA. I was looking at some numbers and came up with this:

**ROLLING OVER ROUTE**

* Lets assume you + employer contribute 22,500 into 401k this year.
* 13,500 goes into Roth ITA after rolling it over (takes a 40% tax hit).
* At a 6% return rate over 30 years, you end up with **81.3k**


Alternatively, 

**KEEPING 401k ROUTE**

* You + employer contribute 22,500 into 401k this year.
* At a 6% return rate over 30 years, you end up with 135.5k.
* Taxed at 40% upon withdrawal, this results in **81.3k**

Since both variants result in the same amount of money after 30 years, what benefits does leaving money in 401k over Roth IRA provide? I am predicting to remain in a high tax bracket post retirement. My view is that a Roth IRA will provide you with more flexibility and higher potential growth if you were to trade with that account, such as selling options against your positions.

What am I failing to consider?"|0.74|t3_18p1jsp|1703321172.0
investing|should the government account for inflation in calculating cost basis?|"As you experts know, currently your cost basis is the price you buy a stock at. If years later you sell the stock at a higher price then you have to pay capital gains tax on it. This isn't exactly fair as this doesn't account for inflation. If you hold a stock and the price doesn't go up, and then 10 years later sell it, you have lost a significant amount of purchasing power due to inflation.

It would be ideal if there was a way to adjust your cost basis vis-a-vis the inflation over that period. This would account for reduced capital gains, but also enabling a capital loss as the cost basis adjust upwards.

Investors would then know how they are doing vs. inflation, and have a true metric on their investments, and the government would be more motivated to deal with inflation when it occurs. Further, people we would be incentivized to invest their cash instead of leaving it on the sideline.

Thoughts? Would governments ever adopt this?

If the stock stays below $52, the call expires worthless and I just collect that $10 premium.

Which is correct. But what if you consistently bought (DCA) but only at the end of down days/weeks? Would the average price you pay be lower than DCA-ing every day/week? Would you have to buy more than you normally would to make up for the money not invested on up days?

Edit: so I ended up writing a script that tested both strategies (DCA and buying on down weeks) using S&amp;P500 data from 2010-2020 and the maximum possible performance increase (with perfect knowledge of how many down weeks there will be in the given timeframe) is about 2% over 10 years.

investing|Any advice on when to offramp from Series I Bonds?|"I know these were super popular last year when inflation was surging. I made 3 purchases between July and November of last year, and it appears the yield for the latest one I purchased will finally dip below 4% in another month or so.

This isn't money I expect to need for quite some time, and my risk-tolerance for this specific chunk of savings is medium. I would like to pull this money out and place it in a high yield savings account (I currently have one with Capital One that's offering 4.35%), and perhaps use it to max out my IRA contributions for next year.

My question concerns what timing I should aim for when cashing out my bonds. Of course, no one knows exactly what interest rates will be a year from now, but let's assume inflation nears 2.5% and interest rate cuts begin by late next year. At what point would the 3-month interest forfeiture be offset by a 1-2% difference in yield? Also interested in what other people have done/will do with their bonds."|0.38|t3_18olr91|1703270269.0
investing|Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin Accounts|"&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.

&amp;#x200B;

AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.

&amp;#x200B;

Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100

&amp;#x200B;

Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785

&amp;#x200B;

I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.

&amp;#x200B;

Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.

&amp;#x200B;

I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?

investing|At what point ($-wise) should one consider a wealth management advisor?|"There's not one clear answer here, but I'm curious of this sub's perspective - are there net worth points at which one should transition between different investment styles?

I'm thinking of this as having 5 ""levels"" (even though realistically at any one point you could probably use a blend, especially of the first 4 options):  
(1) **Ultra-Low Risk Accounts:** Self-directed, investing pretty much solely in ultra-low/zero risk accounts such as FDIC-insured high-yield savings accounts, CDs, I/Muni Bonds, etc.

(2) **Self-Directed/Index-Fund Based:** Generally focused around investing in the S&amp;P, ETFs and/or mutual funds to diversify and access higher returns that are not necessarily risk free, but are still lower-risk

(3) **Robo-Advisor:** Putting money into Wealthfront, Betterment, etc. and paying an initial management fee - usually around 0.25%

(4) **Financial Advisor:** Still going self-directed and using a combination of strategies, but checking in with a financial advisor for some sort of flat fee to receive professional guidance - this would usually be focused on retirement planning, but not necessarily managing your investments for you.

(5) **Wealth Management:** Full-service professional management with fees ranging from 0.30%-1.00%; generally hands-off by the individual investor. Usually includes some sort of tax-planning service and various specialty services such as executive/equity compensation planning.

Now that that expense is behind me, I've been looking over my savings and realized I've been stockpiling and way too liquid as I never knew what to expect with the house.

I currently work two jobs and between both, my gross is about 8k monthly. After deductions, insurance, bills, hsa, I'm saving about 3k per month and have been putting it in my HYSA.

My plan is to increase my contributions to my Roth 401k (currently, I contribute 5% and my employer contributes 9% for a total of 14%) and to resume contributing to my Vanguard Roth IRA to decrease my liquidity.

I stuck to purchasing the Targeted Fund 5050 for my IRA when I contributed in the past but only have a 3% return rate so I am looking at different types of funds and would like some guidance. 

I'm looking at VTI (good expense ratio and growth) and VSMGX (higher expense ratio but also good growth). I've been watching VTI for longer and need to do more research on the Life Strategy Funds that Vanguard offers but I would like to move funds from my HYSA and max out my IRA this year. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!

Are all cds like this? after the 6 or 11 month period it drops down to nothing? or should I be looking for another bank to do this?

investing|An observation, almost all discussion about the market is an echo chamber|"High yield savings, you can't time the market, index funds, etc...

Now, these are actually great strategies -- for the last many years, during which I am guessing most of those chattering about all of this started trading or investing.

DCA works great when everything goes up consistently and you can just sit on your money. However, there are many times in history where you would have to take a loss if you invested for many years and then NEEDED that money at a specific time. Sure, if you could have waited, say 10 years, you'd be good, but... I hope you see my point. 

And the charts don't communicate that reality quite as well. The charts just show a drop and then the inevitable rise back, it's easy to gloss over this. I remember hearing folks who invested in this way talk about taking losses for basically all of the first 10 years of the 2000's.

Any way, tl;dr, this all works great, until it doesn't, and most talking about this type of thing haven't really seen anything other than a low interest rate environment. Just go look at a chart of the S&amp;P and ignore the last 10 years for a moment."|0.45|t3_18nrzfb|1703178927.0

investing|On Index Investing and Why You Don’t Have To Do It|"The point of this post is not to bash index investing, it’s just to make the argument that index investing is not the only way and it isn’t some perfectly superior one-size-fits-all answer. As a secondary point, I want to put it simply that if you believe there is only one acceptable investing style (active/passive), you are in the wrong.

The existence of passive investing strategies such as index ETFs is, imo, nothing short of a miracle for the average person. It allows folks who don’t know anything about financial markets, valuation, research, or much of anything else, to invest their money safely and successfully over a long term. Indexes, therefore, do a world of good for many people.

On the other hand, when we’re in a sub like this, the people who post and comment are mostly not average people who know nothing about financial markets. A good portion here are doing research regularly (some high-quality and some low-quality, of course) and making active investments based on that research. When they post about it, it’s common for others to come along saying “you should only buy [insert index fund]” or even worse, “you’re stupid for using a money manager”, or the openly hostile “you’re a fraud for being a money manager.” 

They often cite statistics, such as the “Boglehead” studies showing that most money managers don’t beat the market, and almost no active investors beat the market. Here’s why active investors should ignore that statistic:

1. Its methodology is deeply flawed because it can’t account for closet indexers. When I come up with 2-3 companies in every industry and I buy them in roughly equal proportions or I weigh more to bigger industries like tech, what I’m doing is known in the investment industry as **closet indexing**. Closet indexers create portfolios that will be highly correlated with index funds and bear much of the same risk-return profile. Now that’s all well and good, but it is an issue when this is classified under “active investing” and a manager is charging a fee for it. When Bogleheads say a manager like that is underperforming, it isn’t some “gotcha”, all they’re proving is that if you buy what’s essentially an index fund, and you pay a fee above the index fund’s fee, you’re going to underperform. That doesn’t prove there’s something wrong with active investing, it just proves there’s something wrong with closet indexing managers. And this isn’t some tiny portion of managers, it’s extremely common. 

So how do we avoid closet indexers? It’s pretty simple - ask about “**active share**.” Active share is the percentage of a portfolio that exactly matches its benchmark. A [series of studies](https://www.ft.com/content/10a5a37c-a96e-11e3-b87c-00144feab7de) found that most managers with high active share underperform, and most managers with low active share outperform. In other words, if you don’t diversify your portfolio but instead use Buffett’s strategy of building positions in a small number of stocks that you fully understand, you will probably outperform.

2. The statistics don’t apply where Bogleheads want to apply them. What I mean by this is, when they say “most people don’t beat the market,” even if that was true, it isn’t relevant. Whatever active management strategy is currently being discussed is the one that has to beat the market, not all strategies or most strategies. When you say to a value investor “90% of investors don’t beat the market,” they’re never going to change their mind, and they shouldn’t, because you haven’t given them a good reason to. **The question is whether most *value investors*,  (and not just people who call themselves that, by the way) beat the market.** This can be extrapolated to other strategies, of course. Do most day traders beat the market? No, not even close. But most day traders also don’t just say “I trade stock daily,” they have one specific strategy. If you don’t have data on that specific strategy, you probably don’t have relevant data to present at all. Anyone and everyone will always say “yes, but I don’t do things like most people in the statistic you just cited,” and it’s probably true. Research on investing strategies is very hard to conduct, and there definitely isn’t conclusive evidence available that tells us much about most strategies.

3. This idea that nobody can expect to outperform is also just obviously false when faced with common-sense reasoning. This isn’t coming from the same standpoints of statistics or abstract logic, but just practical thinking. If someone works in finance and knows the industry well, talks to industry friends about how their work is going, and reads 10-K’s with that unique insight in mind, you simply aren’t going to convince any reasonable person that the average investor in the market knows more about the industry than this person, because that certainly isn’t true.

None of this is to say that nobody should be investing in indexes. I’d even say *most* people should, because most people don’t want to do the research and spend the time it takes to outperform. 

All I want anyone to take from this is that there’s more than one good way to invest, and if you belittle people for active investing, you’re in the wrong."|0.42|t3_18nphm5|1703172269.0

Firstly, Boston Scientific recently resolved their scandal case with LOTUS, which was because they said several years ago that their LOTUS device was the best of the best, and so on. But it later turned out that there were serious problems that were not reported, and the device had to be recalled and stopped selling.  
  
This later caused a big drop in the BSX, but they recently resolved it with a [$38M settlement](https://11thestate.com/cases/boston-scientific-shareholder-settlement), which is obviously good for them.  
  
Boston is also growing steadily over the long term and generally has good dynamics as I see.

investing|I'm a professional money manager and these are some of my notes from premarket 21/12|"  
**What happened yesterday, and my thoughts:**  


* Yesterday, we saw the market start to do a little correction. There wasn’t much news behind the move, except for the fact that VIX options expired, and QQQ failed to break the Call resistance 0DTE at 410. This may have contributed as VIX options had been suppressing VIX till now, and the expiration reset the options positioning a little. As such, VIX moved higher rapidly from 12.5 to 14. For the most part though, this was just normal mean reversion. 
* Markets have been at all time highs, up 16% on SPX since October lows, with 90% of stocks above their 50 day moving average. The market had just become a little too stretched, and needed to breathe. 
* Note that this is of course a very small correction in the scale of the move the market has just done, and is very healthy. Moving indefinitely higher is what’s not healthy. The market has to absorb and digest that move, before moving higher again. In premarket already, we can see the market already start to pare the drop. Over the next few days we will see volume dry up a little going into the Xmas break, and there isn’t much on the economic calendar in the way of major catalysts. With lower volume, we may see markets trade flat, or we can see exacerbated moves in either direction. With little on the economic calendar, it’s hard to guess exactly which way markets will move on a day to day basis. E..g markets are up in premarket, but this can easily fade to retest 4700 at least. On the whole, markets are still stretched despite the 500 point drop on the Dow, but this isn’t to say that today will be red. I caution against making day to day predictions because people call me up if they are in any way wrong. Look, we as investors aren’t fortune tellers, especially when there’s little on the economic calendar to guide us. We can only assess the overall state of the market, to determine risk reward. As readers had noted, I had left my passive positions running (trimmed a bit) and had sold all my active/swing trades, to build cash, because I suspected a near term small correction. I didn’t put the cash into the market yesterday. The dip happened so close to the close that why would I put it in just before, when I have no idea how markets will open tomorrow, especially with little particularly in premarket in way of economic news? The correction, whilst sudden, was still small. So personally, I am waiting to see more before I put the money I had trimmed, back into the market. If it moves higher form here, which premarket points to (although premarket movement means little), I will still be happy as my passive positions make money.   


**My Trades:**  


* (Explaining trades I made in my personal portfolio. People have mentioned rightly not to share too much details about company work, so I have shared trades I was executing in my personal port instead)  

* In terms of what I did yesterday, I explained in yesterday’s post that oil was trading at the top of the downward channel that had been forming. I thought it could easily get rejected there, so I trimmed half my oil positions, and left half running. My price target on oil is 80, so I left some going to meet that, but knew that this could easily get rejected at the top of that channel, so took some out. Technical analysis suggests it can even move lower to 67 now, although you’d have to see a move higher in dollar for that to happen.   

* I also trimmed my enphase position because I was off the desk the day before. Note: I still have some running. I also have positions in FSLR and ARRY. I am bullish on solar still for next year. The reason why I sold some was because I was holding form 80. It was up a lot, and whilst interest rate cuts will help them a lot next year, it doesnt immediately change their near term earnings, which were guided last quarter to be terrible. A 62% move higher in quick time was good enough for me to take some profits here.

**TODAY’S DATA LEDE/MACRO EVENTS:**  


* **UK CBI Trades data:**
   * One of the less important metrics for the Uk, but does give some telling insight, especially because it was such a miss to the downside. Came out -32 vs forecast of -14. It’s a leading indicator of retail performance, so signals a weakening retail sector in UK. (Little impact in GBPUSD because it is a small indicator)  

* **US GDP Final Revision (Q3) - Expected to remain above 5%**  
**PCE revisions too**  
\- note: these are both revisions, and barring a big surprise, won’t move markets too much as should be confirming previous readings.   

* US Jobless Claims  
————  


**INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**  


* Evercore says that they see a big pullback in first half of 2024, as recession “materialises”.   

* Goldman put out a piece where they compared the performance of small caps vs large caps in various markets over the last 12 months. There, they concluded that smalls have only outperformed large in emerging markets. Other than it, in Japan, Europe, US and others, they have underperformed large caps. This is something we all mostly knew anyway, since Mag7 led the rally most of the year. I suppose for those that don’t follow other markets, it’s interesting to know this was the case in other markets too.   

* Goldman put out another piece looking at average inflation across G10 economies. They estimated that across them, core inflation ran at just 2.2% over past 3 months and 1.3% in November alone.   

* Hedge funds net long positions on crude hit record low going back to 2011.   

* Fitch says they expect their next moves from the Fed, ECB and BOE to be cuts - no sh\*t Sherlock. No more hikes from here.   

* Interesting fact: Statista shows that international tourism finally reaches pre pandemic level.

**FOREX**  


* GBP was lower yesterday after soft CPI print and continued slightly lower today. Trading 1.265. Note: I hold position in GBPUSD  

* USDJPY continues doing correction as yen moves higher. This is correction after Yen sell off following BOJ dovishness. Note, can bounce off of 142.59. Then again, can not. Depends on initial jobless claims numbers as they can move the dollar.    

* AUD moving higher again.   
————— 

**MARKETS**   


* SPX: Sold off yesterday a bit back to 4700. Held that level in aftermarket, and pared losses to 4722. ( up 0.5% from lows of yesterday)  

* Nasdaq: Fell to 16,550 yesterday, pared some of those losses in premarket, up 0.7% in premarket from the lows.    

* GER40 tracked the sell off in US overnight. Was relatively flat since.   

* HKG: Opened much lower, after US sell off. Recovered 1.6% from there. Basically pushed up right from the open. Partly due to China economic stimulus measure announcements e.g. cutting deposit rate  

* OIL: Failed to break out of downward channel yesterday. Still testing it in premarket. Needs to close above 75 on daily to break out.   

* VIX: pushed up after expiration. Now at 13 handle.   

* Bond yields slightly higher today, probably as sellers take from bonds into equities.

investing|I am Swing-Trading stock since two years with small amounts of money and it works so far, should I start doing it on a bigger scale?|"2 years ago I created a new account solely for the purpose of me learning to invest into single stocks rather than (what I had done until this point) investing into ETFs and leave it at that. I didn't even start to ""make money fast"" like other people do, but really just to educate myself on some companies and learn something about idiosyncratic risk etc. I started with 900 Euro (about 1000 $) and managed to almost triple that amount in the span of two years. If you guys are interested in the specifics of the trades feel free to ask, but for now to keep it short, I basically did swing trades on a handful of companies on which I did extensive due diligence in advance: namely Airbnb, Shopify, Tesla, and Nvidia. 

Now I am wondering: Should I switch the investment strategy on my ""regular"" account from passive ETF investments to swing-trading individual stocks as well? I would be considered a risk-averse person, so this type of strategy goes against my natural, but 3x-ing my money in two years seems to beat the market by miles. Or was I just ""lucky"" to pick stocks which were going up anyways?

investing|Why should I invest in Real estate instead of going for SP500|"This is my [repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/18ng73d/why_should_i_invest_in_re/) from r/realestateinvesting, which is now closed because of ""low effort or off topic""?! I asked a genuine question and wanted to learn. I hope to get more insights from the more open-minded people here.

Edit: wow guys, I woke up and saw a lot of comments. I appreciate the teaching, constructive reponses a lot. Some comments are weird, some people even sent depression help through DMs. Having never been an RE investor in my life, it's OK it takes pain to learn and I'm glad I got beaten down to fully grasp the concept.

To be clear, I didn't mean RE investment is a bad thing. Nor did I mean RE should replace SP500 entirely. It's another vehicle to diversify your porfolio. I get that.

As I look for efficiency in doing anything in life, the question I should really have asked is, ""Why investing in RE is more efficient than investing in SP500?""

Right after the first few answers last night, I realized I missed a big part of leverage. I fell into the percentage yield trap and did not look under the hood.

The short answer is, **for SP500, to get a 10% return I need 100% ownership of the asset**. On the other hand, in RE, **I do not need 100% ownership of the asset for the appreciation**. If the cashflow is positive, then I should be good. To realize the gain in SP500, I can simply click the sell button, and it is harder to do so in RE.

Mathematically speaking, my equity is an increasing function over time, while the monthly payment is a decreasing function over time, **as long as I'm cashflow positive**. This is the part that puts me into thoughts. It means I have to manage risks such as keeping the job in economy turbulent, managing tenants, dealing with long-ass eviction process if I have to. But I get that, to enjoy the leverage I have to put in the work.

Again, thank you all for all the constructive responses!

Original post below:

\---------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I'm seeking wisdom from the experts. Every millionaire I know owns a few rental properties. I'm not an RE investor (yet), and I'm trying to justify why I should put my liquid assets into RE, giving there are other options such as investing in SP500.

The SP500 yields more than 150% over the past 10 years with an average of 10% return a year. It also has less stress/risk to manage (a simply google or [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp))

I did a simple search for [cities with largest increase in home price](https://constructioncoverage.com/research/cities-with-the-largest-home-price-growth-last-decade) and found that unless you pick the right cities to buy homes in, you will not beat the SP500. Problem is, then you have to manage the property remotely or have your property manager do so which decreases the yield even more. Owning investment properties also comes with finding tenants at times, managing them, dealing with evictions etc.

Money invested in SP500 is liquid, which is not the case with homes.

Based on some of these facts, I'm not super convinced that putting my liquid assets into home, unless I can find homes that appreciates in value of more than 10%/year, in the right city, at the right time. Is this how people do it?

I'm sure I missed something. Please educate me!

Thank you!"|0.42|t3_18ni63l|1703146951.0

Last year I have 6000USD of tax loss carried over into this.

So far, my portfolio has realized gains and losses.  I can just sell stocks/bonds for $6000 profit tax free due to being offset by the losses right?  Since my bank doesn't charge transaction fees, I am thinking about just selling them to turn unrealized gains into realized gains and buy them right back.

investing|Why Did the Market Sell-Off?|"At 1:30pm ET today, SPY hit $475.73 and decisively broke downwards for the day. At 2:05pm ET, it fell below yesterday's close at $474.84, from there it waterfalled all the way to $468.26.

This was a major and abrupt 1.5% slide from the highs of the day.

# Why did it sell off?

First of all, it's without a doubt that the stock market has been overheated for a while now. SPY is hitting all-time-highs, other indices are hitting resistance, fintech stocks are pumping to Mars. In some ways, it feels like we're back in 2020-2021.

However, it's important to note that an overheated market is not a reason to sell. ATHs are often bullish signals, else the indices wouldn't be where we are today.While the exact reason of the sell-off can't be known by us outsiders, there are reasonable speculations. A major one is the selling of 1 million open SPY $475 call options that triggered the sell-off of the index. This sudden spike in selling pressure triggered a cascade of selling as 0-dte options gamblers cut losses and institutions bailed from the market.

This is just one speculation, but a plausible one and backed by market data.

However, we also have to give credit to a negative macroeconomic backdrop. The closing off of the Suez Canal for global shipping due to Houthi aggression in the Red Sea is alarming for inflation. Ships have to divert a long distance around the horn of Africa, significantly increasing time and cost to final destination. Add to this the poor Fedex earnings report from yesterday in which the stock fell over 10%, as well as the already significantly overheated markets, and it's clear there's a growing wall of anxiety in the market. No wonder all it took is a spike in selling for the market to sell off in a big way.Hindsight is 20/20 but that doesn't mean we can't learn from the past.

# So what happens next?

You can be in one of two camps from here. One camp thinks this is a healthy bull market pullback and we'll consolidate around here or below before rocketing back up again.

The second camp thinks that the market is yet to appreciate the full effects of the closing of the Suez Canal, as well as the economic canary in the coal mine from Fedex's earnings report, and this is the start of another major pullback.

The prudent thing to do is to reduce risk, monitor the market and the geopolitical situation, then decide your next move. The situation right now is unknown and highly dynamic and any big bets at this point is premature.

If I had to pick a side, I think this is just a healthy bull market pullback."|0.68|t3_18ncwvv|1703128379.0

I want to open a discussion about the future of AI in the investment world and I'd love to get your thoughts on a specific aspect.  
  
As we are seeing more and more AI driven tools for investment, here's the dilemma:  
  
**Build Your Own AI Model:** This option allows investors to create and fine-tune their own AI models. It's all about personalization, where you get to decide the factors, markets, and risk levels that the AI should consider. It's a bit like crafting your own investment strategy, but with a techy, AI-driven twist.  
  
**Use a Premade AI Model:** This is the plug-and-play option. An AI model that's already been built and trained, ready for you to use. All you need to do is invest based on the model’s recommendations. It’s simpler, but with less flexibility and personal input.  
  
Would you guys be more inclined to build your own AI model, tailoring it to your specific investment philosophy?  
Or, would you prefer the convenience and ease of a premade AI model, even if it means less customization?

somebody tell me why i’m wrong. there has to be a reason more people dont pile into TQQQ but do pile into QQQ to hold for longterm. is it just risk appetite and they dont want to deal with 3x downturns? im 23 so i still have plenty of time to be able to afford high risk so i would be okay with 3x downturns assuming im not missing something big here."|0.77|t3_18n4fqh|1703104304.0
investing|Payment for Order Flow Questions|"I get the gist of what Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) is: the broker partners with a market maker to process the transaction, with allows the market maker to pocket the bid-ask spread and to front-run trades (are these the same thing?). The market maker pays the broker for this privilege, which typically allows the broker to operate without trade commissions. But the bid-ask spread basically acts like an indirect commission (albeit small) since the buyer is paying slightly more than the true price.

The information I haven't been able to find is:

* What is the effective average 'cost' of PFOF?
* Are ETFs included in PFOF and also have an effective cost to trade?
* Is there a limit to the effective cost of PFOF? Can the effective cost change/surge unexpectedly to much higher levels than normal?
* Which brokerage firms engage in PFOF? Are there any that do not?
* Is there a good way of avoiding/boycotting the PFOF system?
* If PFOF is banned, what would happen to brokers whose business models rely on PFOF? Is there any risk for investors given SIPC protection?

The reason why I want to know this information is I am finally ditching Northwestern Mutual in favor of low cost trading somewhere else. I am attracted to Robinhood because of the IRA 1-3% contribution match (and no commissions), but am starting to learn about the ugly truth of PFOF. But I wonder the match would be offset by PFOF in the long-term and whether other low cost brokers (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab) also use PFOF if I wanted to avoid it.

SGOV pays out a monthly dividend on the 20th of every month, with an ex dividend date of the 14th.  HYSA pay interest monthly based on the average daily value of the account.  Could you keep your money in the HYSA, then transfer out to buy SGOV mid month, and sell right after the ex dividend date, put the money back in HYSA and still get the dividend from SGOV?

I once hired him to do a fairly simple project that shouldn't take more than 30 man hours.

Eventually I agreed to 1 assistant and he managed to finish the project and even did half of the work himself, but it was a huge hassle and waste of time for me.

Now he owns half a construction company. I doubt he has ever actually hammered a single nail himself but he seems to be pretty good at directing his employees and the work the've done looks good. He is asking me to invest $100k in a project which will pay $112k in 6 months, leaving $12k profit. He says I would get half of that profit ($6k). Annualised this is a 12% return, which to me seems very small for the amount of risk. I told him that his margins are too small to bring in an investor, especially considering how high interest rates are currently. But he insists that it is a good deal and my profit is guaranteed.

I think there are loads of things which could go wrong with such a deal and have no plans to invest in it. Am I being too harsh? How can I explain to him that this deal is bad?"|0.83|t3_18mrhms|1703067842.0

investing|My lessons from twenty years of trading|"I have always believed in the efficient market hypothesis and that trading is a zero EV endeavor minus commissions and taxes.  I am up huge lifetime because I started in 2003, always went long, never traded financials, and was away on sabatical from 2008 to 2009. I am probably the luckiest person alive.

I do three types of trades: hedging my long term SPY with puts, trading futures to gain exposure and increase diversification, going long on individuals companies in the OEX. I do not believe in technical analysis. I am 100% certain it is astrology for men.

I also do not believe I am capable of fundamental or macro analysis on anything. I have 10,000 hours of macro study and I am certain it does not even give me a .1% edge.

My most profitable trades have been on illiquid LEAP OOM options on OEX companies with spreads greater than 25%.  I have been filled multiple times, but sometimes it can take six months or more to get filled creating re-investment risk.  I feel i have run in the top 5% of luck getting these fills, but there is only reinvestment risk so it is very manageable.

Futures trading is my ultimate drug. After twenty years I am flat minus about 2k commissions. But its more of a hobby than anything. I am a big fan of the ultra ten year, swiss franc, nat gas, and more recently shorting the CME cash settled bitcoin futures (not an ad lol). It is obvious to anyone with sense it is impossible for anyone to have an edge over these ultra liquid markets, but the diversity is nice.

What keeps me interested is the hopes that maybe one trade I might have a small edge. Of course I will never know for certain so I just tell myslf this is true every trade :)"|0.49|t3_18mk7bw|1703041332.0

investing|One Year Rolling “Escrow” Investment Strategy Feedback|"Hello all. I have a house and elected to pay my own taxes and insurance (no escrow). Before interest rates started increasing, I just calculated my taxes/insurance requirement for the year, direct deposited a portion of every paycheck I received to a HYSA and then paid my property taxes and insurance at the end of January.

This past year, I experimented with putting that chunk of money in a Fidelity account instead of the HYSA and every time I accrued more than $1000, I bought a CD or treasury that was scheduled to expire before Jan 31 of the next year. Importantly, I never intended to or actually sold the cd/treasury. I let everything I bought mature, so the liquidity markets did not matter to my strategy. 

I’m wondering what people think of this strategy generally. I believe I averaged better than if I had used a HYSA, but I also fully admit this is more “work” than if I had just left it all in the HYSA or something like SPAXX. Having said that, it takes ten minutes once a month to review the account and grab whatever the best yield is and lock it in.

Over my entire career (probably another 20-25 years), I intend to leave any excess returns in the account in the hopes my excess returns can cover the increases to my taxes and insurance due to inflation, eliminating any need to increase how much I have to deposit per paycheck. 

Are there any holes or blind spots I’m missing in this strategy other than the minimal amount of work required that you guys can think of?"|0.73|t3_18mh1z5|1703032025.0

I, like many others, realized capital losses last year in excess of what I am allowed to claim. So I can use $3k of last year's capital losses to offset gains from this year. As it's approaching end of year, I want to make sure I do this wisely.

I have realized long-term and short-term capital gains this year in excess of $3,000. I also have unrealized long term and short term capital losses in excess of those amounts I could use this year.

Because long-term gains are more tax friendly than short-term gains, I want to ensure the $3k of losses I roll over to this year are used to cancel out short-term gains. Does anyone know if this will automatically happen, if I am able to designate this, or if they will automatically cancel out the long term gains?

Why is the lowering of rates (generally good for business and borrowers) going to cause me pain in my equity investments?

  
*Apr 10, 2023*  
*The bust of the stock market bubble will only be halfway over when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, according to GMO founder Jeremy Grantham. He expects that to happen in late 2024.*  


*The legendary investor — who's made his name predicting market crashes across multiple decades — predicts even more gloom ahead in the market. Previously, Grantham said stocks were in the ""final phase"" before crashing, and asset prices that ballooned in recent years could soon pop as the economy risks facing a steep recession.*

  
*Though some investors are looking for signs of the next bull market, that's the wrong way to think about stocks in the current environment, Grantham said. ""Great Bubbles"" in the stock market are different from typical bull and bear markets, meaning it's likely there's another round of pain ahead.*  


*""Most of the decline in these great bear markets only happens after the first interest rate cut. So you tell me when the first interest rate cut is, and I will tell you when the second half of the pain is going to start,"" Grantham said in an interview with The Investor's Podcast on Friday.*

It’s all about active management   
  
A common theme across 2024 outlooks is that investors will do well to actively manage their portfolios next year. That’s a bit different than the ‘set it and forget it’ long-run investment advice that typically prevails among portfolio managers.  
  
Stocks and bonds have been unusually volatile this year, behaving in ways that aren’t consistent with economic expectations, wrote Jack Manley, global market strategist at JPMorgan. Given those “significant dislocations,” he said “simply owning the indices will not suffice.”  
  
That means an investment strategy that relies on broad market movements to generate returns, rather than on specific stock selection or other active management strategies, may fall short.  
  
“Investors need to take a more active approach to their portfolios. This is not a time to switch on the investing autopilot; it’s a time to take the controls,” wrote analysts at BlackRock. “It’s important to be deliberate in taking portfolio risk, in our view, and we expect to deploy more risk over the next year.”"|0.73|t3_18m9qyj|1703012980.0

This has done me really well over the years, but I've had recent doubts after chatting to a (supposedly) finance-savvy friend of mine. He advised me that although my money was in an index fund, and therefore automatically diversified amongst sectors, that my geographical diversification was poor and I should consider investing in something like VEUR to get some exposure to european markets. 

Is this good advice? I'm a little skeptical, since this would mean investing in a new index fund rather than just pumping more money into the, historically lucrative, S&amp;P500. Is this a good idea?

investing|Mercedes Benz group: Thoughts?|"All,

Have had this on my watchlist for a while and recently bought 100 stocks. I have some more cash and was wondering if investing more makes sense or not. Below is my reasoning for MBG.

- current price: ~63
- 52 week high: ~76
- 52 week low: ~55
- dividend yield: ~8%
- P/E: 4.5 (5 year average ~11)

Now looking at financials:

Revenue growth 5Y: -1.8%.
Gross margin: 22.8% with 5 year avg of 20.8%
Operating margin: 12% with 5 year avg of 7.2%
Net profit margin: 10% with 5 year avg of 5.6%

Though revenues have stagnated in last 5 years, they are expected to grow revenues to 165 billion euros by 2027. Improving margins should strongly boost their bottom line.

Free cash flow generated over last 5 years is about 28 billion ( annual  avg of about 5.6 billion). In 9 months in 2023 itself , free cash flow is about 5 billion euros.

Conclusion:

Considering that EU will protect its automobile industry from cheap Chinese cars, and MBG has a strong footing in luxury cars, I feel that this stock is a strong buy. Given inflation and recessionary outlook, growth is limited in the short term but they are improving their fundamentals and margins. Over last 3 years, they have generated strong and healthy cash flows and the 8% dividend is cherry on top."|0.55|t3_18m0010|1702986318.0

investing|What are your thoughts on this Roth IRA portfolio breakdown?|"Thoughts on this portfolio?

My thought process for this portfolio is this: 

I like having the VOO in there for steady reliable growth so that’s why that’s at 20%. And when looking at the top companies (right now) within the S&amp;P 500 they are mostly tech. I honestly don’t see these companies disappearing off the map like a lot of tech companies did back in the internet boom. I think they have secured a foothold to be around for a good while. That being said that’s why I allocated another 20% in VGT which focuses and has higher weights on these top tech companies (see second photo which shows weights on companies in S&amp;P 500 and how tech dominates the top 20 or so). To balance out the rest of the portfolio I have both SCHD and SCHG. I wanted to have a strong dividend ETF In there so hence the SCHD at 40% and then finally I threw in SCHG at 20% for some potential large growth, albeit higher risk as well. I am 32 years old and just getting started in investing through a vanguard Roth IRA which I am maxing out.

My company with over 2000 employees recently went public and has offered and ESPP.

We can contribute 1-10% of our base salary and the company will match 15% of the contributions.

Is this a no brainer? I need some proper guidance.

So i asked the HR and this is how it goes—


How do l estimate what my per pay deduction will be?

Take your annual base salary e.g, $40,000
Divide this by 24 pay periods = $1,666.67 per pay period


Decide how much you want to contribute e.g., 10% Your contribution = 10% × 1,666.67 = $166.67 per pay The company will match 15% = 15% × 166.67 = $25.00


Your net pay will be reduced by $166.66 plus tax on the company match. (if you are in the 27% tax bracket this means ~$6.75 in tax)


At the end of the offering period (6 pays in a quarter) you will have accumulated
6 x $166.67 = $1000 plus $150 of company match"|0.78|t3_18lvcxo|1702967480.0

investing|Is “time in the market is better than timing the market” sometimes propaganda?|"Sometimes I wonder if the popular push for middle class investors to DCA invest in passive index funds is a “do as I say, not as I do” recommendation when coming from wealthy investors. The wealthy seem to use cash reserves quite often to buy up equities, from stock to real estate, during economic downturns—something that I at least understand to be one of the drivers of contemporary wealth inequality.

I guess the point could be that these people are ALSO investing in the market and that this buying with cash reserves is additional spending. Could also be some survivorship bias. But to the degree that “timing the market is a fool’s errand” rhetoric dominates, as opposed maybe to “solely timing the market…” (?), I’m skeptical. Thoughts?

investing|Paying off mortgage vs investing|"Do those of you who are buying a house at \~7% interest invest in other things or does it make sense to put most of your extra income towards your house to get the guaranteed \~7% ""return."" 

Obviously an emergency fund and getting an employers 401K match would be a priority, but after that, it seems hard to beat a guaranteed tax-free ""return"" of 7%.

I ask because we bought a smaller house before the market went nuts and had two kids since, and realized the schools we're zoned for are pretty awful, plus we'd like a bigger house now that we have kids. We thought we were being financially smart by purchasing a smaller house than we could afford. We got what we needed at the time, assuming we'd be able to upgrade, if needed. But now we're kinda screwed and are going to have almost 3x the mortgage rate if we move. Investing made sense when the house loan was cheap, but if we do decide to move, I feel like I'd just need to throw money at the new house until it was fully paid off.

Also, what's the consensus on what to do if you currently have a low-interest loan house, but need/want to move. Keep it and rent it out, while taking out a larger mortgage on the new house, or sell it so you can put more money towards the new house and have a lower high-interest rate mortgage?

Maybe it's not possible. I'm interested in what you think is the best option but also in the range of options available, and any substitutes that I might be missing.

For example, let's say we have a bank account and we want to keep $1000 in it. At the end of each month, it will have between $500 and $2000 in it. At that point, f there's anything above that $1000, we want to move it automatically into a money market mutual fund or similar place.

I see a lot of discussion about this but I don't feel like I understand the range of available options and which information is outdated. For example, I might be hyper-focusing on things referred to as sweep accounts and missing an obvious alternative way to achieve the same thing, or maybe I'm hyper-focusing on MMMFs instead of a good substitute.

* [It seems like some similar programs use the word ""sweep.""](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sweepaccount.asp)
* This option is often described as a feature of the destination fund.
* [This maybe became less possible/less common over time.](https://cranedata.com/archives/all-articles/7050/)
* I think a number of brokers (e.g. [Vanguard](https://personal1.vanguard.com/pdf/Bank_Sweep_Terms_of_Use.pdf), [Fidelity](https://accountopening.fidelity.com/ftgw/aong/aongapp/fdicBankList?type=ira), [IBKR](https://ibkrguides.com/advisorportal/homemenu/excessfundssweep.htm), [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/legal/sip-sweep-current-interest-rates)) have something like this, often using a combination of partner banks instead of a money market mutual fund, and often requiring a different/fancier/more bank account-like account than a typical brokerage account.

investing|E-Trade stock conversion issue after recent acquisition|"Hi all, I am a former VMware (VMW) employee, now part of Broadcom (AVGO), after the recent acquisition. E-Trade is the brokerage handling employee shares for VMware, and consequently the distribution of shares + cash after the deal closed.

I had elected 100% share conversions to AVGO for my 4.5 years of ESPP and vested RSU. More shares vested after the initial election, and I elected them to be converted to 100% AVGO as well.

The acquisition deal closed end of November, the payout ratio was determined as 52% share conversion to AVGO and 48% cash. Instead of honoring the stock conversion ratio that was decided, all my shares have been cashed out by E-Trade. We know of at least 55 confirmed employees affected by this issue, and about 100-150 have indicated they might have been affected.

I happen to have screenshots of my elections.

E-Trade has been telling inconsistent stories to the affected people. Primarily, that we needed to elect the entirety of the original election again while making the second election, because the second election overwrote the first election. Which I have proof of that there was no option to do so. The second election only allowed the newly vested shares to be elected, and after the election, as per the screenshot and their UI, the quantity of shares remaining to choose election was 0. The folks who were not affected by this issue only made elections for the newly vested shares as well.

E-Trade has been dismissing everyone who's been calling them, and we've been doing that almost daily. They are saying they cannot do anything. They haven't yet officially closed the complaint we have written to them.

At an individual level,

1. It's an outright value loss of \~$52/share based on the effective share price at the payout ratio of 52:48. That amounts to tens of thousands of dollars for me.
2. I have to pay more taxes now for all the liquid cash.
3. The value of AVGO has skyrocketed since the deal close. I lose all those gains.
4. Even if I were to buy AVGO now, my cost basis is reset to current price, vs earning them at a lower price from 4.5 years of hard work.
5. I don't get dividend payouts that AVGO is excellent for.

Has anyone experienced such an issue with E-Trade or any brokerage during an acquisition? Any suggestions on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: E-Trade made an error for stock conversion from VMW to AVGO, for several employees, which resulted in tens of thousands of dollars of losses for me. And they are not willing to do anything about it."|0.6|t3_18l5a1e|1702893997.0

But I feel like the longer I wait the longer that money sits making returns well below something like VTI. 

I totally understand that 2023 has been a bull year for equities and I know that we can never time the market so I do not want to “wait for a recession” - so do I dump it all in just at once? Do I do $10k a month for 15 months? How am I able to figure out the best way to do this?

Thanks!

Edit to add: this is general savings with a long time frame. Retirement about 25 years out. 

Thanks everyone for the helpful insights. Funnily enough the presented research of “DCA vs Lump Sum” shows that Lump Sum performs better 2/3 of the time over a long period, and about 2/3 of these comments are advocating for it. Parallels!"|0.78|t3_18l9o9o|1702908840.0

investing|The Stories on Bitcoin's value|"You've all probably heard the stories on Bitcoin's value. Stories that portray Bitcoin not only as valuable, but precious. Stories by which buying bitcoins is one of the smartest things you can do. Well, all of that is just cheap propaganda. A bait to lure you to buy something worthless.

Bitcoins cannot be eaten or drunk. They cannot be seen like artwork or heard like music. They cannot be used to operate computers and execute specific tasks like computer software. They cannot be driven like a car or worn like jewelry. In short, bitcoins have no intrinsic value. When you buy them, you only get a short record, e.g. '5.1234 BTC'.

If someone issued a record and offered it to the public, they must redeem it. The record has to have redemption value. Casino chips, fiat currencies, shares, or gift cards are examples of such records. When you hold them, all you can see is a short string of characters written on digital, plastic or paper media. There is nothing intrinsically valuable to consume or utilize. That's why their issuers must redeem them for something.

Casinos redeem their chips for cash. Banks redeem their currencies for debt servicing and liens release. Namely, units of fiat currencies are issued as debt owed to banks - individuals and companies owe it to commercial banks based on loans, while governments owe it to central banks based on bonds. That's why the banks redeem deposits and banknotes for reducing or closing that debt and releasing liens on the property that secures it. Corporations, if they decide to end their business operations, redeem their shares for funds from liquidated assets. Finally, retailers redeem their gift cards for goods or services.

On the other hand, Satoshi Nakamoto, as the issuer of bitcoins, does not redeem them. He issues them through the protocol he wrote but never redeems from anyone. If you invested electricity to make his system work and got bitcoins for it, Nakamoto won't redeem them even for a dime. Everyone who holds bitcoins knows this. They know that bitcoins have neither redemption nor intrinsic value. They know that bitcoins are worthless. That is why they are forced to get rid of them, sell them to someone. And to do this successfully, they need to publicly promote Bitcoin as valuable. They need to compare it to gold, diamonds or artwork. They must say it is the superior version of fiat currencies or money in general. That it can save us from greedy banks. That it is revolutionary like the Internet. That it is scarce. That it solves corruption or financial and economic problems. That it can lift poor countries out of poverty. They need to sugarcoat Bitcoin.

All these stories are of course ridiculous. They would be such even if bitcoins were units of equity, like shares or units of debt, like fiat currencies. But bitcoins are units of the number 21 million. Nakamoto came up with it in his imagination, after which he wrote a protocol that assigns its units to online addresses and stores them in a decentralized database.

Numbers, whether they are stored centrally or decentrally, don't have magical powers. They cannot solve corruption, play the role of artwork or precious metals, lift countries out of poverty, save us from banks, or be scarce. They cannot be money if they are non-redeemable because there's nothing to compare with the value of goods and services. Those who make up or spread such stories know very well they are ridiculous. But they do it out of necessity. They invested huge amounts of redeemable records and intrinsically valuable items into the scheme and must get them back. On the one hand, they don't want to be the bag holders. On the other hand, they want to profit from the scheme as much as possible. And that is literally all the wisdom behind the stories on Bitcoin's value. "|0.38|t3_18l2hsd|1702882206.0
investing|Does anyone have familiarity Fidelity’s Tax-Managed U.S. Equity Index Strategy?|"Hi all - I currently have a pretty passive investing strategy (sp 500 index funds, some bond indexes, and etfs), but I was contacted by Fidelity about investing in an active managed fund they offer. I have traditionally stayed away from these types of funds based on the logic that the management fees are not worth whatever benefit they may offer trying to “beat the market”.

However, the presented pitch was that this fund is not attempting to beat the market on straight returns, but is instead aiming to provide maximum returns through a reduced tax strategy based on strategic buying and selling of stock. The fund data I have reviewed from fidelity shows a return about 1% higher than benchmark after management fees (the fee is .4%). This was over the 14 year lifetime of the fund which was started in 2010.

investing|"Here is what I learnt from ""The richest man in Babylon"""|"I didn't read the whole book as after a point I personally felt that it was repeating its principles. But whatever I read, I learnt from it a lot.

# 10% - The price you pay

Key take away is that ""A PART OF ALL YOU EARN IS YOURS TO KEEP"". And precisely it is 10%. 10% of your income is yours to keep where you will employ that money to make money for yourself consistently.

We can argue that we are not able to make meets end, needs are growing with increasing/stuck income. If you are not in debt and still you got to complain about 10% then there is something that needs to be sorted out because if you want to be wealthy, you have to pay yourself first. And that is 10% of what you make.

""Live below your means"". That t-shirt can wait. Maybe that trip can wait. All these can wait until you pay yourself 10% first.

Note that you won't become too wealthy from it. Compounding returns will need time. Much more time. To live by this thought, look up to Warren Buffet who got his &gt; 90% of networth after he was 50 years. It took him a long time, from 10 years old to 50 years old to have this crazy compounding.

# Advice on getting advice

Second emphasis that I have noted in book is ""taking advice from wise people who knows how to manage and multiply money"".

This is so true in our time because there are lots and lots of scammers who lure you in for hefty profits &amp; once you are trapped, your money is gone.

Finding wise people is as hard as making profits in derivatives market where 95% people took loss and remaining 5%'s profit had 15-50% of transaction fees.

But looking back and retrace the path that ""wise"" people have taken throughout their lifetime is beneficial and that ""looking back and learning from that"" is nothing but ""learning from their success &amp; failures""

# Conclusion

Although there ARE many learnings which I have missed but I have shared what I relate most.

Personally I was only saving 3-4% of my income by excusing myself about the ""needs"" that I have to fullfill. But after reading this, I have pledged my 10% income to be mine and only mine which would go to investments in several mechanisms.

And another measure that I have taken is to educate myself from the wise. Reading about investors, their strategies and watching courses.

I would be back with my personal learnings on ""The Psychology of Money"" once I am ready."|0.45|t3_18kgd08|1702816199.0

If true then it seems the 529 could be treated like a HSA. You leave it in, let it grow, and only withdraw later with your saved college expense receipts. If you have money left over you can pass it down to your kids.

Is anyone aware of this or was I misinformed?

Update: thanks all for your comments - it seems I was misinformed. Additional point here:   


When it comes to 529 plan withdrawals, it's essential to align the timing of the distributions with the year in which the qualifying educational expenses are incurred. This requirement isn't explicitly stated as an IRS rule, but it is strongly implied by published IRS guidance and agreed upon by tax professionals.  
  
The rationale behind this timing alignment is to prevent potential misuse of 529 plans. For example, if funds in a 529 plan are allowed to grow tax-deferred over an extended period and then withdrawn to pay for expenses incurred in a previous year, it could lead to financial benefits that the plan isn't designed to provide. This practice could potentially be seen as an abuse of the tax advantages of 529 plans."|0.7|t3_18kb9lp|1702795238.0

investing|Would it be accurate to say that equities soak up inflation, and therefore are inflation sponges?|"Is this what distinguishes the dollar from other currencies? People will often say the dollar retains hegemony as the worlds reserve currency because of things like it is backed by the US military, that it is the most stable, that US citizens and residents need it to pay taxes, and while I think there is truth to all these points, I think the real reason the US dollar has retained hegemony is by virtue of the fact you can't invest in US equities without dollars. 

This goes for international investors, but the real driving force is the domestic market. Whenever the money supply expands due to monetary policy from the central bank, or a commercials bank issuing a loan, one way or another, that money after being taxed several times, transacted several times, eventually finds its way to the equities market. 

Unlike other countries where if their money supply expands, the money is primarily spent on consumer goods and services. 

So this means that the more vibrant a countries' equity market is, the less likely it is to experience inflation even if it has stimulative monetary policy.

investing|Why is the market overvalued?|"From a numbers standpoint, we are near all time highs. I definitely agree with that notion. However, isn’t the stock market technically supposed to be about an average return (over time) 7% ABOVE inflation? 

We have had a cumulative \~22.80% inflation since Jan 2020 (according to truflation), and we are still barely away from the all time highs of 2021 (which WAS overvalued in my opinion). However, inflation caught up to us, and technically, being at the same level in 2021 account for inflation does not make it seem like the market is overvalued, but more in line with inflation adjusted returns.

Am I seeing this wrongly? It seems any drop would also have to account for 22% inflation, in which the money is already devalued. If we were to stay at the same spot we were when the market was say (sp500 particularly) at 4700, you would be in inflation adjusted terms \~3700 (with 22% inflation). 

The index is just a number, but the index doesn’t account for inflation, or am I missing a big point, for example, earnings not particularly keeping up with the risk reward?"|0.46|t3_18k6o07|1702778779.0
investing|Exploring the Concept of Using a HELOC to Accelerate Mortgage Payoff: Seeking Investor Insights and Personal Experiences.|"Exploring the Concept of Using a HELOC to Accelerate Mortgage Payoff: Seeking Investor Insights and Personal Experiences

I've come across intriguing content on YouTube and various platforms that proposes a financial strategy involving the use of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to both cover living expenses and accelerate the repayment of a mortgage. While this approach seems unconventional and potentially rewarding, it also raises red flags regarding its inherent risks and potential complications.

As investors, we are accustomed to assessing risk and reward in various financial endeavors. The notion of relying on a HELOC to sustain one's lifestyle while simultaneously paying down a mortgage faster appears to be a high-stakes maneuver. I'm keen to delve into the experiences of this community to gain a deeper understanding of the practicalities and challenges associated with such a strategy.

For those who have explored or implemented this financial approach, could you share your insights? What were the tangible outcomes, both positive and negative? Were there unforeseen challenges that emerged during the process? How did this strategy influence your overall financial stability and impact your investment portfolio?

Recognizing the subjectivity of personal finance decisions, I believe that a collective exchange of experiences within this community will provide nuanced perspectives for those contemplating a similar course of action. This discussion aims to dissect the risks, benefits, and intricacies tied to using a HELOC as a tool for hastening mortgage repayment. Your firsthand accounts will undoubtedly serve as valuable guideposts for individuals navigating the complexities of this intriguing but potentially precarious financial landscape. Let's foster an insightful conversation that enriches our collective understanding and aids those navigating this uncharted territory.

My idea to hedge the risk was a standard ATM cost-less/slight cost collar strategy assuming the bump up on his shares at IPO is favorable, probably in the 15%-30% range is ideal, I’ll be looking more into the S-10 when its released to see their property portfolio and do a proper valuation and due diligence, but he wants to sell anyway as he doesn’t really need the income considering his age.

My question is, in order to minimize as much downside risk, is there really any better option than a collar strategy? I mean he could short a subset of peers in the same REIT sector if the bump up on IPO is insignificant, but I don’t think he wants to do an L/S strategy here considering possible dislocation between the sides of the trade due to IPO volatility and general market qualms."|0.38|t3_18jv5lx|1702745223.0

My way of thinking is that based on how young and how risk adverse you are you should calculate how much diversification you need.

investing|Going all in on Small Cap Value?|"

I've recently been toying with the idea of going 100% globally diversified small cap value. If one has a sufficiently long time, incredibly steady income, and is not bothered by extended periods of underperforming the S&amp;P 500... why not go 100% SCV and just add bonds as you near retirement? 

It seems like the Larry Swedrow portfolio basically does this, and Paul Merriman has mentioned it for young investors before as well. 

As for the portfolio allocation, there are a couple of ways to do this. Avantis and Dimensional make suitable funds, and you can just mimic the standard VTI/VXUS split with the corresponding SCV funds or just split it right down the middle and keep it 50/50. 

I know some will feel that this goes against the boglehead mindset, but it is rooted in the same fundamental ideas. Given the reliability of the size and value premiums over the last hundred years or so (in addition to market risk exposure), you are still diversified. Arguably more so than VT. It's also a very simple strategy of buy and hold investing with relatively low costs, reducing risk as you near retirement...

investing|Legal advice on avoiding US federal/state tax implications|"ONLY LEGAL SUGGESTIONS!!! if the answer is “you can’t legally avoid US taxes” then O.K.

In this hypothetical..

You live and work in U.S., citizenship.

Obviously you pay income taxes on your salary and whatever investments (401k, HYSA interest, HSA, etc).

Let’s take HYSA for example. It’s 5% APY.

Is there a way to enroll as a foreigner in another country’s HYSA plan or similar alike?

So you can get the 5% growth without U.S. state/federal taxes?

Obviously for this to work the country in question has to have 3 things:

1) not comply or share info with the U.S.

2) have NO tax implications OR have that country tax rate lower than US. Preferably a lot lower for the juice to be worth the squeeze.

3) I like the insurance aspect of US - FDIC. I would need something similar for me to store mass amounts of money offshore.

Side preference - I would prefer the funds to be somewhat liquid, as an emergency. That I can withdraw within 30 days or so. My ultimate plan would be to keep funds in there accruing interest indefinitely.

———

I know movies aren’t a smart thing to bring up. But in movies, a “Swiss Bank Account.” Is talked about. Although unsure if that’s if you’re a criminal or just trying to save money.

———-

Now what about income you earn abroad but store in US accounts? I know the APY will be taxable but would the income earned/issued abroad be taxable by US government?"|0.11|t3_18j4q1b|1702659650.0

investing|Timing allocation switch - short term treasury ETF to broad bond ETF|"So I have a brokerage account for kids college and home improvements, will need the money in the 3-12 year time frame. Keeping it fairly conservative.

Earlier this week it was 50% S&amp;P 500 index  ETF and 50% short term treasury ETF (paying monthly dividends at a rate based on 1-3 month treasuries, so about 5% annualized return).

With the consensus that rates shouldn’t go much higher, I already moved half the treasury ETF into a broad bond index.

My question is: how precisely is a broad bond index price linked to current Fed rates (versus say 10 yr Treasury rate, or expectations of future Fed fund rates?). Looking at past charts, I expect a broad bond index should pop 10-20% over the next 1-2 years. However, I noticed my broad bond index ETF already popped up 1-2% this week, seemingly based on expectations (or 10 year treasury rate decrease).

Basically, I’m wondering if I should keep 25% allocated to short term treasury ETF and take the safe 5% return until Fed cuts come, OR should I move that 25% to a broad bond index immediately to get ahead of a 10-20% bump that may come from ‘expectations’ in advance of actual rate cuts?"|0.33|t3_18j0t19|1702648989.0

Firstly, a bunch of biotech companies is constantly dealing with the FDA, then lawsuits, then FDA again, and it goes on and on. In recent cases, for instance, [Fibrogen](https://11thestate.com/cases/fibrogen-shareholder-settlement) is in the process of settling its mess over an anemia drug, lots of companies accused of not disclosing FDA investigations properly, and it turns out, it's not just investigations but potential patent revocations. Many other companies, like Bloom Energy and Kiromic, had troublesome IPOs (and I won't even mention Kiromic's performance).  
  
In my view, the fact that biotech companies are constantly facing lawsuits is a downward slide for all of them, which signals a decline in performance and overall dynamics (just my humble opinion tho).

investing|This investment may have merit. What are your thoughts?|"# Financials

New.Egg Commerce Inc ( $ N E G G ) has substantially-reduced its expenses over the last few years. Revenues, too, are back on the rise: around $2 Billion per annum. Derivatives are positive all across the board, with a rising cash position pushing from $50 Million to $100 Million likely this quarter. It is unknown why the market capitalization is showing as 20% of the current revenue. Price to sales ratio reveals that the stock could be fundamentally discounted.

# Developments

The company is now the *de facto* leader in Artificial Intelligence for e-commerce. Reports since the beginning of 2023 show a legitimate expansion of their machine learning team(s). $N E G G has not only revolutionized the techniques for gaining new customers using internal big-data statistical processing, but they have disrupted the world with their GPT-assisted reviewal process. New.Egg continues to expand itself into an Artificial Intelligence powerhouse, which makes sense considering New.egg sells the very H100 and A100 developer platforms that they use... not to mention the advanced Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) that they allow customers to trade back in.

The company not only accepts and hoards cryptocurrency for \[and after\] each sale, but they participate directly in the crypto industry: selling crypto-mining-ready GPUs, crypto-mining-ready CPU ASICS, and crypto-mining-ready rigs.

The company further participates in electronic sports (esports), selling pro-gaming-ready PCs and gaming stations. Newegg also sponsors pro-gaming organizations, creating an industry synergy now for future sector growth.

The company participates in selling technology of all kinds: from laptops, tablets, and phones for audiences that include students, professionals, and businesses.

On leadership and confidence, the company recently announced a buyback of $10 Million worth of shares, even though the free float was already as low as 19 Million shares still available. Further, and although there is no evidence to suggest that the buyback even started yet, it only took the company three weeks to meet and satisfy Nasdaq's minimum listing requirements. Any downward threat was abated in near-record time.

# Technicals

The stock quickly pushed up to $2.48 last week. This reflects positively on the board, who overcame and dismantled the naysayers of the discounted stock. When compared with the stock's 2021 price range of around $80.00 per share, one can reasonably ask when the stock will retest those recently-obtained levels. Trendlines are visible at $20.00 per share and $90.00 per share right now.

# TLDR

Shown above, New.Egg Stock ( $ N E G G ) is already the *de facto* leader in Artificial Intelligence in e-commerce. Also a leader in the cryptocurrency mining and esports/pro-gaming industries, New.Egg's financials are showing positive derivatives across the board. $2 Billion per annum range of revenues with market capitalization curiously-discounted at just over 20% of current revenues. With share buybacks announced, and now fully Nasdaq-compliant, I am eager to read what your thoughts are regarding $ N E G G stock..."|0.33|t3_18ioy7h|1702605488.0

investing|Why Lockheed Martin (LMT) Might Be a Smart Investment Right Now|"Hey r/investing,

With some recent developments in the defense sector, I think it’s worth taking a closer look at Lockheed Martin (LMT). Here’s why:

1. New Contracts: LMT just bagged a $175M contract for the F-35 Fighter Aircraft, showcasing its ongoing dominance in the aerospace sector. This is on top of a massive $443M contract for the Black Hawk helicopter. These contracts not only boost revenue but also reaffirm Lockheed’s position as a top defense contractor. If this all wasn’t enough, the House and Senate have just approved a $886.3 billion defense policy bill, and Lockheed Martin, being a leading defense contractor, often benefits from increased defense spending.

2. Stable Revenue Stream: Lockheed’s consistent government contracts, especially from the U.S. Department of Defense, provide a stable and predictable revenue stream. In an uncertain economic climate, this stability is gold.

3. Innovation Leader: LMT is at the forefront of defense technology. From advanced fighter jets to cutting-edge missile systems, their focus on R&amp;D means they’re ahead of the curve.

4. Dividend Payouts: Lockheed’s history of paying dividends is attractive. They’ve been known to increase their dividend payouts.

5. Global Security Demand: With rising global security challenges, the demand for defense equipment isn’t going down anytime soon. Lockheed, with its diverse range of defense products, is well-positioned to meet this demand.

6. Economic Resilience: Defense stocks like LMT tend to be more resilient to economic downturns. Defense spending often remains stable or even increases, regardless of the economic climate.

However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. There are risks, like dependency on government policies and global political dynamics. But overall, LMT’s recent contract wins and its strong position in the defense sector make it a stock worth considering.

What do you all think? Is LMT a good long-term play, or are there better options out there in the defense sector?

investing|Gold Prices to Hit Record Highs in 2024, ING Bank Forecasts|"Gold has reached record highs this year, propelled by geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. ING anticipates continued strength in gold prices through 2024, underpinned by safe-haven demand and the evolving outlook for US interest rates. 

According to the Netherlands-based bank's research, the recent surge in gold prices, particularly in the last quarter of 2023, can be attributed to an increased appetite for safe-haven assets amid growing uncertainties. The outbreak of the Israel-Hamas conflict in October pushed gold close to its previous record of $2,075/oz set in 2020. Despite the easing of concerns over a broader Middle East conflict, gold has maintained its strength, supported by a softer US dollar and favorable US Treasury yields. This upward trajectory culminated in a new record high for gold prices in early December.

The key determinant for gold's outlook, according to ING, is the Federal Reserve's policy. The strength of the US dollar and central bank tightening have exerted downward pressure on gold throughout 2023. However, recent data indicating a cooling labor market and inflation, coupled with market expectations of a rate cut in the coming months, could shift this dynamic. 

Other market participants share the same view. 

“Once central banks stop tightening and start easing rates, which could be next year, gold will probably go higher,” says Bruce Liegel, a macro fund manager and author of the research newsletter Global Macro Playbook. “If we have a global recession, it will impact the amount of easing that the central banks will carry out. The more easing, the higher gold can go later next year and into 2025.”

ING's US economist anticipates rate cuts starting in May, totaling 150 basis points in 2024, and an additional 100 basis points in early 2025. This is expected to provide significant support for gold's upward movement.

The outlook for gold's trajectory hinges on the magnitude of the rate cut, contingent on whether there is a hard or soft landing in the economy.

“The future path of gold is probably higher, and it's going to be determined by the degree of the landing,” says Liegel, who writes a monthly global macro report. “If it’s a hard landing, it will go up a lot more because the central banks will need to ease more. A soft landing means that less easing is required.”

While gold demand trends present a mixed picture, ING foresees a resurgence of investor interest in 2024. Despite ongoing outflows from gold-backed ETFs, sentiment turned positive in October, reflected in net-long positioning. This suggests that there is still room for speculators to contribute to net-long positions in the coming year.

Central banks have also continued to be significant players in thegold market increasing their reserves by approximately 800 tonnes over the first three quarters of 2023. This record-setting pace is driven by concerns over geopolitical tensions and shifting strategies on currency reserves. Notable contributors to this surge include China, Poland, Turkey, and India. Central bank demand, along with sustained investor interest, positions gold favorably for continued strength.

ING notes that the continued buying trend from central banks, together with a weak US dollar on the back of US monetary easing, may set the stage for gold to reach new highs in 2024. The bank anticipates prices to average $2,031 per ounce in 2024, with a fourth-quarter average of $2,100 per ounce. Downside risks revolve around US monetary policy and a stronger dollar, while geopolitical instability remains an upside factor for gold markets in the coming year.

With the Fed went [dovish](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-markets-markets-soar-on-dovish-fed-.html) yesterday and potentially going for rate cuts next year, I do see a bull case for gold.

2. Same option as #1 but live in the property 2 years. Possibly rent out a room for additional income. After two years saving put that into another property and rent it out?

investing|Thoughts about OXY dropping in price|"Occidential Petroleum has recently sharply dropped in price. Background for this is the acquisition of CrownRock, another oil producer in the Permian basin, for $12b. OXY also overtakes the debt of CrownRock for $1.2b.

About $9b is financed via debt, but they also issue lots of new shares, diluting the current sharebase.

The company had already $42b in liabilities vs. $29b in equities, of which $8b is prefered stock. So that's a lot of debt. They have said that they wanted to use their cash flow to reduce their debt in the upcoming years.

Wall street sees the company very skeptical. The shareprice dropped to $55.5, down from $63 at the beginning of the year.

Warren Buffet has been very bullish on this company for the last couple of years, owning now 25% of the whole company. He's been continuously buying throughout 2023, for a share price of $62-63. Even though he did not finance this acquisition specifically, he must have approved of it -- CEO Vicki Hollub flew to Omaha end of November.

Warren Buffet is obviously bullish on America and also on oil. But that amount of debt is scary, and oil is probably not a ""forever""-bet. Right now, he is betting against the market, having paid a hefty premium to the current price. Another possibility is that it's just a current slump, because the market is flooded with new shares.

But either the market or Buffet is wrong. Which should mean that people who are still convinced of Buffet's genius have now a chance to snatch one of his top favorites for a song.

Any thoughts on OXY long-term? 

Disclosure: OXY is my second biggest single stock holding, at $57. Yesterday, I upped my stake slightly. So my bets are on Buffet more than on the market.

investing|"I don't understand the ""free ride"" T+2 penalty when day trading, can you explain?"|"I'm in the U.S.

I've read many things on websites about the T+2 rule when it comes to trading with unsettled funds, but can someone explain for this particular scenario:

1. I sold shares of a stock yesterday (Monday). The funds are unsettled and I presume the settlement date is then two days later on Wednesday, right?
2. However, today (Tuesday) I used the unsettled funds to repurchase the same stock.

According to every site I've found on the internet, I can sell these shares tomorrow, Wednesday, and I shouldn't incur a free ride penalty.

However, I wanted to see what ChatGPT said about this (out of curiosity, I wouldn't risk a penalty solely based on what it says), and it said I now have to wait until Thursday to sell these shares or it will be a free ride. It said that by repurchasing the shares on Tuesday, this reset the settlement date.

I don't understand this. Why would it reset/add on an additional day? Is this simply ChatGPT being incorrect, as it's sometimes known to be, or did I really just add on an extra day when I repurchased the shares.

Also, additional questions if you can answer, but not as important:

1. Do brokerage accounts normally show this somewhere, an indicator when its safe to sell shares again? I dont see that anywhere in my Schwab account.
2. At what time of day is it ok to sell on the settlement day? As soon as the markets open?

Thank you

edit:  
I appreciate those who seriously tried to answer my question. I don't think anyone is understanding what the actual question is though. See this illustration of T+2:  
[https://www.ally.com/content/ally/en/content-hub/invest/what-are-unsettled-funds/\_jcr\_content/root/main/article/section\_969635282\_co/row/column/image.img.png/1671587208026/unsettled-funds-in-line.png](https://www.ally.com/content/ally/en/content-hub/invest/what-are-unsettled-funds/_jcr_content/root/main/article/section_969635282_co/row/column/image.img.png/1671587208026/unsettled-funds-in-line.png)  


Note: At the bottom of the illustration it says, ""the proceeds from the sale will be in your account DURING the settlement period and MAY BE USED to purchase other securities WITH UNSETTLED FUNDS.""  


That's correct (my brokerage firm told me this in 2006), that's fine, that's what I've been doing for 20 years. However, the question is, if you purchase other securities on Wednesday in that chart (The settlement period, which, again, is perfectly OK to do), how long must you then wait to resell them again? Can you resell them on Thursday (the original settlement day in the chart)? Or does that then push the settlement date forward an additional day and you must wait until Friday to sell?

These charts, this rule of buying with unsettled funds, are all over the internet and it's a very clear rule, not something you have to ask your brokerage account about. So the question I'm asking is a twist on that rule but would also be a very clear rule, most sites online just haven't answered that.

**""Contact your brokerage firm.""**

I should clarify because many are saying ""contact your brokerage."" My brokerage is in the U.S. and I'm in SE Asia. I only added ""I'm in the US"" so people know I'm playing by U.S. SEC rules, that these are U.S. stocks I'm trading, but it's much easier to come on here and ask people then to have to top-up Skype and then stay up until 2am to call my brokerage when they open. It's just a major hassle compared to coming to a sub called ""Investing,"" which I presumed was meant for asking and answering investment questions.

Also easier to simply say ""I'm in the US"" so people don't respond with ""depends on your country's laws."" I didn't anticipate so many people telling me to call my brokerage in a sub meant for helping people with investment questions, so I didn't want to get into this big explanation about where I live and why I haven't called them. This isn't really something that should require a call if people understand what I'm asking.

I'm asking about hard rules on trading that apply to everyone when it comes to trading with unsettled funds, not something personalized to me and my situation and not something specific to my brokerage. It's something you should be able to open a book and see as a hard rule, something that should be posted on most investment sites. It's not a nuanced situation personal to me or my brokerage. It's something most day traders would be familiar with (except those like me who have always just waited until the funds settled as a precaution).

**""Margin account vs non-margin account.""**  
Not relevant. If I'm trying to trade with unsettled funds, that means I'm not trading on margin. Appreciate the effort to help but I don't want this to distract from the question. For those mentioning a margin account, yes, a margin account, for example, would be ideal, but I don't have that so I'm asking what the rules are without a margin account.

Again, appreciate the responses but this is something that's a pretty dry, clear cut rule that would apply to anyone buying with unsettled funds. Something that would be posted on a website for everyone to read as a general rule (and I'm sure it's posted out there somewhere, just can't find it), not something I should have to call my brokerage about. It's not a nuanced situation.

- Very strong financial management with debt reduction and high dividend (9.5%)
- Decreasing demand for cigarettes.

- Leveraging pricing power quite effectively.
- Horrible stewardship but in S&amp;P500
- Dividend (9.2%)

PM: - Aims to be predominantly smoke free by 2025. Lead brands include IQOS and ZYN with good performance.
- Very good strategic pricing approach.
- 3/4th of income is from non US/China consumers. 
- Dividend (5.5%)

OVERALL:
- All 3 focus on alternative products in response to declining cigarette volumes and changing consumer perspectives.
- BTI’s recent performance and aggressive move towards non-combustibles positions them favorably for growth despite recent lagging.

My 2023 gross income will be around $90k (residency + Saturday moonlighting during residency + real job started in August). My yearly income from now should be minimum 180k gross, and in future a lot more as I plan to own my own practice in a couple years. Don't think MAGI will be any lower than ~170k either after factoring in IRA &amp; HSA contributions.

**No 401k or any retirement accounts are offered at my current job!**. Kinda sucks, because I know that's needed for Mega backdoor Roth.

I have about 30k in a Vanguard Roth IRA from the past. Contributed the max to it for 2022 as well. 

Other investments: 

-Have 10k in Fidelity 403b thru residency.

-Just added max to Fidelity HSA I just opened.

-30k in Robinhood ETFs. 

So this will be the last year I can likely contribute to a Roth IRA without doing Backdoor. My question is should I put it all in a Roth, Traditional, or a mix? My dad is advising me to do Traditional but I'm fuzzy on the reasoning. Also if I do Traditional now, will it cause issues with trying to do Backdoor in future?

He's also suggesting to open it via Robinhood for 1% match. Whereas I would rather stick with Vanguard or perhaps move everything to Fidelity since I have a couple other things there and prefer the interface. Any thoughts on that as well?

Background:
My dad (59) worked his way bottom-up over the span of 30+ years into a great job running a factory in a rural area. He wants to retire soon and live off social security and income from investments. 

Financials:
- Makes ~$150k base, with highly variable bonuses from $60-200k each year
- No debt whatsoever - fully paid for (inexpensive) house and cars
- Low cost of living, rural area 
- Has $700k in HYSA and CDs, will likely have $800k in profit sharing account upon retirement 

Retirement:
- Will draw total of ~$4k/mo with wife on social security if he waits until 62 (I think) to draw
- Wants to have investment income to supplement their lifestyle, ideally a nest egg 

Investing knowledge:
- Has invested in single stocks for fun before
- Understands HYSA and CDs
- Suspicious of investment vehicles he hasn’t had time to understand (mutual/index funds, bonds, etc) 

How should I advise my dad on:
- When to retire
- What types of investments make the most sense given his goals and needs
- How he can implement a strategy accordingly (literally where and how to open accounts, how to move money, hire a financial advisor, etc)"|0.5|t3_18gbgxz|1702348655.0

investing|Annual year-end explanation for large, unexpected drops in your fund|" Please read before posting.

A mutual fund is pooled investment vehicle with a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever.

Within the fund, the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So, dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year (because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder).

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid-December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example - a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash (and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution (except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. ETFs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies or use the creation/redemption to wash out appreciated shares so they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: [https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates](https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/56970/2020-capital-gains-estimates). Chances are it's on one of these two pages. If not, google search ""\_\_\_\_\_\_ funds capital gains distributions 2023""

investing|Does the end of the tax year affect asset prices in the UK?|"I have a holding in a UK company I used to work for. It’s too much to sell at once without paying CGT, so I’m intending to spread the sale over the next 10 years to avoid CGT (and because I think their prospects are good).

Because I’m fairly optimistic for the share price, I intend to offload as late as possible in each tax year. This led me to wonder: is it common for investors to sell nearer the end of a tax year?

I was made aware of the 5%(ish) sales charge from the beginning but as a 20 yr old with no frame of reference I assumed it was par for the course. I check the balance of this account every few months or so and I also have a 401k at work, but otherwise haven’t given much thought to retirement planning.

I wasn’t aware of any kind of controversy or negativity surrounding Primerica until the other day when a comedian I like joked that Primerica is a scam. This was a big surprise to me. My stomach dropped when I found this subreddit and quickly realized I would have been better off investing elsewhere.

For the past 8 years I’ve contributed $200 monthly totaling around 24.5k. The current balance of my account is sitting at 33.5k. If I understand correctly, this would be about a 37% gain or 4.5% annually (not the 7-10% I had hoped for).

If I transfer everything out of my account I’m assuming I’ll be hit with some gnarly fees. Can I just stop making any contributions until retirement and set up a Roth IRA somewhere else or would that not be allowed since they stand to gain nothing from the lack of sales charges?

investing|Thought Exercises Regarding Risk and Timespans|"I’m trying to thoroughly internalize the importance of diversification for investing portfolios and develop a more nuanced understanding for trading off risk and average return.

My understanding starts from two claims:
A) Diversification does not improve average infinite-time return.
B) Diversification helps protect against variance in returns for a limited time horizon. Eg, the scenario of your portfolio being at a low when you need to sell or not growing enough to meet the goal you set for it.

If you know that you won’t need (and importantly, won’t touch) a fund for X years, then the amount of diversification should be higher as X shrinks, right? This is exactly how vanguard’s target date funds work, I think.

Then, some thought experiments:

1) is there any target date for which it wouldn’t make sense to diversify at all? If you were absolutely certain that you could leave money untouched for 200 years (for some odd hypothetical situation), would you design that target date fund to purely maximize average return until 2050, then start diversifying?

2) if you were willing to fully gamble on a portfolio and only wanted to maximize average return, would it make sense to diversify at all? For this hypothetical situation, let’s say it’s an untouchable fund that will go to charity when you die. You can tolerate all risk, can’t pull anything out even if you wanted to, and simply want the biggest expected charitable impact."|0.67|t3_18el9p6|1702150812.0
investing|Using Retirement funds for business investment?|"After working for 15ish years in a full-time job, I decided to make the jump and go freelance two years ago. It’s been great, I’m making more money, and my work-life balance has improved dramatically. I’m now confident that I can do this and make it work, and am excited to grow my business.  

I have the opportunity to purchase some equipment that will increase my income as well, but I am trying to figure out the best way to make it happen. 

The equipment costs ~$130k.  However, each day that I use it, I can charge $2,000 in rental fees. A conservative estimate would be 30 rentals per year, so ~$60k year. It would pay for itself in a little over two years. After that, it’s extra income. I’d estimate it will last about 8 years before becoming obsolete.  If those numbers hold true, it should net a profit of around $350k over the initial investment. 


From my time at my day job, I managed to save ~$200k in a retirement account.

My question is:  Would it make sense to pull that money out of my retirement for the equipment purchase?  I know that touching retirement accounts early is usually a terrible idea - but I also see this as just a different type of investment, and I feel more confident investing in my business than I do leaving it to the whims of the market. 

If I leave it in the market, even with a 10% return, I’m looking at about ~$150k profit in 8 years vs ~$350k from the equipment. 

Also - if I were to pull it out, I know I’d have to pay income tax on it. However, if I immediately use the money to buy the gear, it will be deductible, and net out the added income from cashing out. I know I’d have to pay the early withdrawal penalty, but from my math I still come out on top. 

Financing could be another option - but I would prefer to avoid that with interest rates this high.  And the interest would most likely still be higher than the early withdrawal penalty. 

I’m 39, so I still have 20-25 years before retirement.  

Any thoughts would be great!  Thanks!"|0.67|t3_18el4eg|1702150402.0
investing|What happens in bond funds when the bonds mature?|"first Question is whether Bond Index ETFs hold to maturity, if not the question is moot.

the second question. Let’s assume a fund bought a $100 3 year bond for 2% interest in 2020. This bond likely was worth say $80 due to the poor yield. on the books it’s held as a value of $80 which reduces the value of the ETF. However the day it matures, it’s worth $100 again. Do these assets just climb back towards par as they mature Or does it happen all at once at maturity?

Or am I thinking about this incorrectly?

&amp;#x200B;

my reference point is that I hold individual bonds that fluctuate some in value but I don’t care as I will hold to maturity, however ETFs seem to report daily value."|0.79|t3_18ekxba|1702149843.0
investing|Help me Understand Cash Flow vs Equities|"It appears that some investors have a strong preference for dividend-generating investments like commercial real estate and oil and gas wells. These are typically the domain of private equity investors who evaluate opportunities based on metrics such as NPV, IRR, EBITDA. Conversely, there are the more casual equity investors who often follow the traditional advice of investing in index funds.   
Clearly, these represent two distinct investment philosophies, but where do they intersect?  


Consider these two scenarios with an initial investment of $1,000,000:  


1) Investment in Residential Mortgage Notes  
This involves buying mortgages secured by real property, offering a consistent IRR of 10-15%. Reinvesting dividends in more mortgages could increase the IRR to 25%, accounting for taxes. This option provides flexibility in cash flow and liquidity for individual notes. Over 30 years, reinvesting dividends could lead to a 31% IRR and a business generating $200,000 monthly cash flow.  


2) Investment in VOO  
This option offers no control but requires minimal effort and incurs no taxes until the investment is sold. A 7% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) would result in $7,600,000 over 30 years.  


The key question is: At what point does the IRR or mortgage note yield make the first option more attractive than the second? What are your thoughts on this comparison?"|0.43|t3_18ejn84|1702146271.0

Who will it be? You are about to start seeing even more Rivians on the road. Maybe net profit in 2025/6. Meaningful profit will come after GA plant is built. BTW, the scale and size of this plant. 

So, in the next couple years how are we going to survive? We’ll have to raise. Why deny it? What an investor should do is look at how previous raises were done and ignore how the stock responded. The GA plant deal with the state of GA was a solid deal for both the State and RIVN. And we get a monstrous, state of the art plant. 🇺🇸🇺🇸

The raise before that, to sustain operations, was executive artistry and the stock was destroyed. No dilution until 2030 at $23 a share and locked in 3% interest. 

I trust management to perform their next raise in a way that protects shareholders. And history gives me no reason to believe other wise. 

Reason 4-6:

Demand/higher interest rates/economy

RJ says plainly demand is not a problem. Can we back up the statement? No paid ads while every other company is buying ad space, even though apparently Amazon is now advertising us for free on Thursday night football. Increased prices while everyone else lowering prices. Increased deliveries from estimated 50 to 54k deliveries. 84k deliveries planned for next year will be gravy. After that, Georgias on our mind and we’ll have more models/more optimizations and more scale leading to more profit. 

Reason 7-&gt;

The stock is shit:

I can’t argue that, that’s why I’ve made money buying puts. It’s not shit anymore.

EDIT: I think I was incorrect in saying 85k next year. 85K doesn’t come until after current plant upgrades have been made so that’s more like middle of 24 to middle of 25 or something. We’ll have more details on that soon and quite honestly in my opinion, it could be a Berish catalyst at this point."|0.59|t3_18dju3i|1702030645.0

investing|Looking for advice from bad decisions|"Imgur link is a pic of said account

[https://imgur.com/gallery/GQcowt9](https://imgur.com/gallery/GQcowt9)

Back during the GME phase, I made some good and not so good decisions. I made some quick money, then made some more. Got cocky and ""Lost"" even more. Currently sitting on this what I now call speculations and not investments, I'm not entirely sure where to move with them. This is the first time I've been in this situation as this is what started my journey.

This may be more well suited for Canadian investing due to the account type but none the less there is a bigger group here for the same advice.

I probably would have dropped the two bigger holdings by now if it wasn't in a TFSA(Tax sheltered), which would result in contribution room loss. My biggest concern is with CLOV and CLNE. I don't really have money to average down( I do but it goes elsewhere), which would be super easy but suffers the same fate as my current situation. As well my investing strategy has since then changed after reading and learning about these mistakes. I'd very much like to average down on both, to slowly recover some of the value and then drop them entirely. CLOV swings quiet a bit from .90-1.25+ and there could be money made that way. In the end I'd like to just hold out and wait for a recovery but with the purchase prices I'm not sure that's an option, so averaging down may be necessary for that to happen.

Really appreciate any thoughts, advice or what you'd do personally."|0.75|t3_18dev9a|1702010459.0

My new employer plan offers TD funds (.05 ER) as well as ‘Vanguard Employee Benefit Index Fund’ (.0016 ER). 

I couldn’t believe how low the index fund fee was and am thinking of just lump summing the $100k into it.

Going forward, my thought is 100% pre tax dollars into the index fund I reference above. I’m comfortable being aggressive now, maybe in 20 years I’ll start to incorporate more bonds. Allocating 20% to a 2060 TD fund is on the table too, but they are relatively redundant at this point in time.

investing|Rollover IRA - Continue investing in Target Date 2055 Fund (Vanguard) or purchase a Managed Fund (Fidelity Contrafund)|"Just changed employers and the new employer does not offer a 401k. I am rolling over my current vested 401k balance to a Rollover IRA w/ Fidelity, where I already have my personal brokerage accounts.

At the previous employer, my 401k was invested in Vanguards Target 2055 Retirement Fund. With the Rollover IRA @ Fidelity, I have the option to continue to invest in this fund. But I would like to explore other options, such as Fidelity Contrafund, at this time.

I'm familiar with Contrafund as I'm invested in it now through my standard brokerage account and have been for about 7-8 years, and am happy with its performance.

For context, I'm 35 years old and am not spooked by market fluctuations - this is a long term hold and as I move closer to retirement, I will diversify into ""safer"" investments that are less adverse to a down market.

When comparing the 2 funds, the ""Hypothetical 10 year growth of $10,000"", as displayed by Fidelity's comparison tool, shows Contrafund outperforming Vanguard 2055 in a way that cannot be ignored - Roughly 30k final fund growth for Contrafund, compared to \~20k final fund growth for Vanguard 2055.

TLDR: If I'm looking for more aggressive growth over the next 10-15 years, would it make sense to invest my 401k funds within my new Rollover IRA account in Fidelity Contrafund instead of continuing with Vanguard 2055 Retirement Fund, and diversify down the road?"|0.4|t3_18d5dsw|1701982591.0

If rates move lower I have tremendous upside holding that long dated bond and can just sell that long dated bond for a nice profit and let that 1 year mature. If rates just stay the same, well then I have some nice guaranteed income from the long dated bond and also have some access to some short term cash with the 1 year.

investing|Understanding dividend yield of maturity date bond fund|"Hello,

I'm helping my family invest and I'm looking at their fixed income asset allocation. The criteria they asked for was:

* Getting back the money near the end of 2028, for a potential liquidity need they might have in early 2029
* Distributing dividends/interest, because they like getting some dividends to pay for trip expenses
* We are non US. residents or citizens, so investing in bonds or, in the case of funds, UCITs trading in the LSE


Following the Boglehead's advice on their Wikia, and after reading some other threads here, I came upon the concepts of maturity date bond fund UCITs. It would make sense that a distributing maturity date bond fund provides the liquidity my family needs, both yearly as well as at maturity, and reduces the risk of a single company defaulting.

Specifically I saw this one trading in the LSE: https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/331715/ishares-ibonds-dec-2028-term-corp-ucits-etf

Here's some info from the website and the factsheet:

* Weighted Average YTM as of 05/Dec/2023 5.16%
* Weighted Avg Coupon as of 05/Dec/2023 4.25
* Distribution Yield 0.35%
* Quarterly distributions
* TER 0,12%


Where I'm getting confused is this. 

1) There's no Yield to Worst information, right? I'd assume most of the bonds inside the fund are callable.
2) Even though the YTM is 5.16% and the weighted average coupon is 4.25%, this thing is only distributing 0.35% * 4 = 1.4% right? Not anywhere close to the 4% of the average coupon. Where's the extra yield going to?

investing|Am I doing well for my age?|"Recently, I've been grappling with a profound sense of inadequacy compared to others. The emotional toll is particularly intense because over the years, I've experienced significant losses that seem unparalleled within my friend circle and community. In 2021, I recklessly invested 30k of my life savings in meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, resulting in substantial unrealized losses. Although there's potential for recovery, the hindsight of what could have been achieved by simply investing in index funds weighs heavily on me. Additionally, the legalization of sports gambling in 2022 led me to impulsively squander my paychecks throughout that year.

Thankfully, I halted these destructive patterns in late 2022 and managed to save up 25k. Yet, the nagging thought persists that this sum could have been 100k had I chosen a more prudent investment path. In total, I estimate my cash losses to be in the range of 50-60k. Complicating matters, both my older and younger brothers were entangled in this financial rollercoaster, borrowing money and experiencing losses. While my older brother, now in medical school, promises to repay his debts along with potential gains, the financial aftermath remains a burden.

At 25 years old, with an income of 55k and relatively low expenses around 1500, I've decided against homeownership, preferring the multi-generational living model seen in my home country. This arrangement resonates with me, and I foresee it becoming more prevalent in the United States.

Adding to my current distress is the unfulfilled promise I made to myself at the beginning of the year to invest in Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I hesitated, waiting for a specific price point based on a YouTuber's prediction. The cryptocurrency bottomed at 15.5k instead of the predicted 12k, leaving me with regret. Had I acted, my plan was to hold onto it for a few years, selling at a projected 100k and offsetting the losses from my 2021-2022 mistakes.

In light of all this, my question is: How do I overcome this emotional and financial burden?"|0.35|t3_18cflvy|1701900275.0

This marketing taken on it's own, is no big deal, but when you look at it in the context of how much Intels market share has declined, and how they are starting to pay TSMC to make their products.  This is starting to look like things are getting pretty weak in Intel land.

investing|Cash App has wildly inaccurate information|"So I was looking into Warner Bros. (WBD) and I was looking at long term charts and noticed something as I was looking at TD Ameritrade while also looking at Cash App on my phone. If you look at both charts, the Cash App chart for Warner Bros shows a stock price of $87.47 on January 6, 2014. The Yahoo Finance chart (which shows the same price as TD) shows that the stock price for Warner Bros was $44.70 on the exact same date.

I even saw on other stat sites like Statmuse that they had a price of $87.47 while the big name financial sites have it as a price of $44.70.

Is there a reason these charts are so wildly different? I mean how can one broker show the stock price at a certain level and another broker shows the price at a different level. I mean shouldn’t they all be portraying the correct price of the stock? Are they just making up numbers when they make these charts? Am I missing something here?

Also, I only noticed this on this one stock. Imagine how many other inaccuracies there are on their app. If they are wrong about the prices, is that illegal?

investing|locking in cost on yield via options?|"trying to understand the principles and tactics involved as I have no experience with options and LEAPS. 

many dividend stocks and CEFs seem to have this nasty little habit of declining stock price over time, plus a decent amount of volatility. But if NAV stays mostly intact, that wouldn't bother me too much.

is there a way to lock in a specific cost on yield by buying options? Especially in a longer term position where the investment hypothesis is that the company will continue to pay some dividend even if they reduce it some during rough times, my total return would be okay even if the payout fluctuates. 

my general understanding is that options and long term options (leaps?) are meant for this purpose: to lock in a cost basis and reduce risk. 

if I am worried about a potential realized loss of, say, 30% in case of wanting to sell 10 years down the line, can I buy a put option at today's price with a 10 year expiration?

For context I’m currently in graduate school and am no longer working. The past two years I’ve worked and been able to max out my Roth contributions while not making enough to be taxed when filing. I currently have ~35000 dollars in a brokerage account. I have made 808 taxable dollars in dividends and that is my only income for the year. I would like to try and contribute more than that. So I was wondering if it is possible (legal?) to sell all of my current long term investments that are positive then reinvest them. If I did this I would net ~5200 as income bumping me up to around 6000 to contribute to my Roth. Am I allowed to just sell my current gains and repurchase their positions, or does that form a sort of wash for tax purposes? If not could I potentially pivot to different holdings? If that is possible is there any other way I could generate the extra 500$ dollars of apparent income to max my contribution? Thanks in advance.

investing|How do markets react so quickly to macroeconomic news?|"As an example, Moody's downgraded China this morning. I won't speculate on what this means for individual stocks, but perhaps a good case to consider for arguments sake.

News such as this will have 1st order impacts (e.g. companies holding Chinese sovereign bonds will see a fall in their asset values, all else being equal). However, if I'm not mistaken, firms will not publish detailed and up-to-date ledgers of their holdings - so how is the market so quick to quantify these first-order impacts on the values of individual companies?

Second order impacts might be that lesser security in Chinese markets leads to greater demand for, say, US assets and helps to boost US markets. I imagine these second order impacts are even more difficult to quantify.

There will also be third, fourth, fifth (etc) order impacts which will become increasingly difficult to quantify.

So my question is: how do markets respond with such conviction to financial news?

Additional questions:

 \*  In general, are the first order impacts over-pronounced with nth order impacts given too little weighting?

 \* Do markets typically underestimate or overestimate the implications of financial news?

EDIT: To clarify, this is not a question of how markets _react_ so quickly to news. It’s a question of how markets quantify the impact of a piece of news quickly. I expect you could spend 3 years writing a PhD on the likely impact of a single piece of news."|0.7|t3_18bavs6|1701779176.0

investing|TradInvestors moving to blockchain|"Hey everyone!

I'm reaching out to the investing community with a focus on understanding how traditional investors are perceiving the integration of blockchain technology into their investment activities. 

As we know, blockchain has been a game-changer in various sectors, and its influence is increasingly being felt in the investment world. One of the key developments I've observed is how blockchain is reducing barriers to investing compared to traditional markets (e.g. improved accessibility, enhanced transparency, instant finality, etc.) As blockchain technology matures, we're witnessing the emergence of new applications that bridge traditional investing with the blockchain world. A prime example of this is the tokenized real-world assets protocols. These protocols are revolutionizing how we approach traditional assets like stocks, commodities, and bonds by bringing them on-chain.

This integration raises several questions:

* Is the shift towards blockchain and tokenization something that excites the majority of traditional investors? 
* Have you encountered the realm of tokenized real-world assets in your investment journey?We're seeing large institutions like Blackrock showing interest in asset tokenization. What do you think drives this push, and are you aware of the benefits they see in this move?

I am genuinely interested in your thoughts and experiences. Whether you're deeply in blockchain technology or just //observing//, speak out and let us hear you :D I'm especially keen on understanding any reservations or second thoughts you might have regarding this technological shift in the investment landscape.

Basically the government said, don't try and tweak the chips to get around the restrictions on china. The statement basically said that the government will classify the chips as restricted as quickly as Nvidia can develop them.

20-25% of Nvidia revenue comes from china. This won't wipe all of that out, but it will eat into it. This makes it even harder for Nvidia to achieve record growth.

Oh, and make no mistake: with the P/E as high as it is, it's not enough for Nvidia to do well: it has to do EXTREMELY well to justify it's valuation. IMO, the downside risk in the short term is far higher than the upside risk.

That is the risk with chasing market leaders, as so many people do. By the time a stock looks like it's so good how can you not own it, you're already far behind the best opportunities for gains and possibly already in the danger zone."|0.64|t3_18b0m3y|1701740919.0
investing|HYSA or Treasury Bond funds|"I am very curious to know what other's thoughts are holding $$ in a HYSA versus an ETF that tracks the returns of treasury bonds.

I currently hold $X in a HYSA. I need this $$ to 1) face zero risk and 2) be accessible without penalty within a few days. 

Right now, the best return I can get through my financial institutions while meeting these conditions is a 5% yield. A quick google search showed me that I can get as high as a 5.4% APY (Popular Direct), with others close by (5.35% My Banking Direct, for example).

I am considering moving this money to an ETF like SGOV. SGOV also offers zero risk, and right now it pays a monthly dividend equivalent to a 5.23% yield. This is slightly more than I am getting right now in my HYSA and slightly less than the best available (according to my google search). 

I looked back over the past three years to compare the strategies. (I didn't do a formal backtest, just looking at charts online.)  What I noticed is that SGOV seemed to track closely with the fed funds rate and also the rates for my HYSA. I also noticed that before June 2022, when the fed funds rate hadnt skyrocketed yet, the yield for the long term bond funds (for examples TLT) exceeded that of SGOV and other short term funds, as well as the rates for any HYSA. 

So for instance, during the period of June 2020-June 2023, if I had held $X in TLT from June 2020 to June 2022, and then shifted it to SGOV in June 2023, I would have gotten a better return than possible with any HYSA.

What do y'all think? Besides having to actively manage between short-term and long-term bond funds, is there any drawback to a bond funds ETF strategy like I describe above?"|0.8|t3_18b0e34|1701740252.0

investing|Stocks with heavy losses - sell or hold?|"I'm in a situation that surely is not uncommon, and wondering what others' thoughts are and how y'all usually handle this.

I have several stocks that for me have been clear losers, dropping to \~5-10% of cost basis. (In many cases 'cos I had the misfortune of getting into the market in a big way in Jan 2021 when a lot of tech stocks were at a peak... but that's largely besides the point.)

Examples if anyone is curious: &gt;!LMND, OUST, FVRR, CHPT!&lt;

At this point, my holdings in them are in most cases worth only a few tens or couple hundreds of dollars (I generally put on the order of $1-2k into any given stock to start with), and even for those which now have positive outlooks and which have been making significant positive moves, realistically that's only gonna reduce my losses on them from like 90% to 80%.

In this sort of situation, is it worth holding on to them at all?

On the one hand, the potential for *further* loss at this point is small, while there's maybe still some potential for upside (albeit probably also small).

On the other hand, further loss is still loss, and offloading them would give me a couple fewer things to keep track of.

So, what would you do in this sort of scenario?

(And additionally - how would that change if the holdings were in a Roth or similar account vs. a taxable brokerage account?)

investing|I reallt don't want to make the same mistakes at age 25|"I am determined not to repeat the financial mistakes I made in my early 20s, specifically during the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. In that period, I squandered all my life savings and every paycheck on speculative investments such as meme stocks, penny stocks, and sports gambling, resulting in a significant loss of around $50,000. Fortunately, at 25 years old, I recognize the importance of learning from this experience now rather than facing similar setbacks in my late 30s or 40s.

As of the end of this month, I anticipate having $40,000 saved. Reflecting on missed opportunities, I regret not investing $15,000 in Bitcoin at the beginning of 2023, especially considering the current price. While I acknowledge this as a 'what if' scenario, I had set my purchase target at $10,000, realizing the mistake in hindsight.

To avoid repeating past errors, I am seeking advice on prudent and secure investment options for my $40,000. One consideration is maxing out my IRA, but as I haven't contributed to one before, I am uncertain about the process. With an annual income of $55,000 and monthly expenses of approximately $1,500, I am debt-free. If I choose to maximize my IRA, would investing in index funds like Vanguard or the S&amp;P 500 be a wise decision?

Additionally, I am contemplating allocating $10,000 to cryptocurrency, particularly Chainlink, based on the recommendation of a friend who has been accurate about Bitcoin and Ethereum predictions. Despite the potential for substantial gains, I am apprehensive about the risk of a market crash, given my history of unfortunate stock investments.

Given my apprehensions and past experiences of investments turning sour, I am open to exploring other avenues for a favorable return on investment. My primary goal is to avoid another financial setback and preserve and grow my savings wisely.

A bulk of money is sitting in HYSA and CDs, with returns taxable as ordinary income and subject to state tax. The yield at my HYSA is 4.4%.

investing|Funding a Roth IRA Strategy|"I hope this is subreddit is an appropriate place to ask this. Tried r/IRA and r/RothIRA, but those both seem to be inactive.

Because of my and my wife's income, I thought I was ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA. Somewhat embarrassingly, at age 42 I just learned about back door Roth IRAs in the last week. After a little more research, I'm planning on opening the accounts this week, but had a question about funding the Roth.  
  
Plan to max out my contribution for 2023 in one lump sum, but moving forward I was thinking about shifting a portion of the automatic deposits I have going to my brokerage account and have those deposited in the traditional IRA account automatically instead, and have the annual limit maxed out by the end of each year. I think I would then need to manually have them moved to the Roth account.  
  
A couple things I've read and watched said this was a bad idea, and I'm trying to make sure I understand why. Obviously, one negative would be that it's better to have all of the money there as early as possible to maximize growth. The other thing I've read is that it is just more work to ""trickle"" fund it instead of a lump sum.  
  
Anything else I'm missing that would explain why this would be a bad strategy? One thing I want to make sure of is that I don't have to fill out multiple 8606 tax forms for each of the smaller transfers, but I would assume one form would suffice for all deposits for that tax year.

However if i was to say short a call position and someone buys this off me , and i then close my position before expiry ,im out of the transaction ,but then what happens to the person i sold the call position ,what happens to the person i bought the call position from ,are they paired up ? The other question i had was i read on investopedia that when offsetting ,it doesnt matter what securities that are being used in the contract as long as they all have the same issuer, strike, and maturity features.How is this possible though,like if im shorting a call option and then want to offset it ,i cant write another call option and then buy that to offset my original short position , it just doesnt make sense ,and on top of that surely what securities you use matter when you are offsetting ,as in it has to be the same type and amount of shares ,cant just be in any shares. investopedia link :https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offsetting-transaction.asp its under the headline Understanding Offsetting Transactions  
  
 Furthermore when i wrote this short contract can i sell my position to someone else ?as in selling the position of delivering the underlying stock to whoever bought my call or put(is their a term for this) , in a similar way when someone buys a call or put they can sell their position to someone else (or offset it ).

investing|Bond fund and fed interest rate|"Here are 2 charts of US Bond fund FXNAX and Fed interest rates from Dec 2018 to Dec 2023  


[FXNAX vs Fed interest rate](https://imgur.com/a/zuR9d3Z)  
from the charts you can see  
1 - The bond fund peaked when Fed rate dropped near 0  
2 - The bond fund continue its decline until Oct 2023  
Looks like it's directly correlated to the anticipation of rate hike - 1. It peaked around Apr 2020 as Fed had no room to further cut rate - it's near zero. 2. around Oct 2023, FXNAX finally stopped the dropping and moving up - as more and more data indicates inflation is under control and further rate hike anticipation dissipated.  
I have been DCA into FXNAX since beginning of the year and I want to accelerate the process in next couple of months, not sure if this is 'timing the market' but I don't think Feds are going to significantly raise the rate.  
Do you think this strategy is flawed? If so why?

I did not know their portfolio (2021 thanksgiving) when I said to all of them  to diversify when they were all bragging about their all stock portfolio with huge gains.

I thought he was buying 2 grand worth of treasury I-bonds for him and aunt. My question here was how to explain bond market and pacify them - Thanks for the good answers)

About couple of years ago while discussing investments with family, I encouraged family older members to diversify their portfolio and de-risk after big gains of the market after covid recovery.   My aunt and uncle took this to their heart as they realized that good chunk (35%) of their portfolio is purely US stocks (They have $fixed deposits and dividend paying mutual funds too).  They opened Vanguard account sold some stocks and bought  Total Bond market and total  international bond mutual funds or ETF's.  They also bought some Real estate mutual funds and total stock market mutual funds.

Now they regret that decision as all those they bought are 14 -20% loss  except for total stock funds

If they would have kept most of their stocks, it  would have been 10 to 15% gain instead

PS: They are super rich with lot of cash and few investment properties that get them rental income

They always told us the stock portfolio was their answer to gambling urges but with a few the big tech stocks like   Google, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, MSFT etc

I feel really bad I let them down

investing|What incentivizes 401(k) plan administrators to offer so few investment options?|"Edit: Title should read ""plan **sponsors**"" not ""plan administrators""

We all know that 401(k)s/403(b)s typically have fewer options to invest in compared to IRAs and traditional brokerage accounts (unless the 401(k)/403(b) allows a ""self-directed brokerage account"" option that typically costs the investor high fees.) For instance, my 403(b) with TIAA at a decently-sized university offers only a single passively-managed index fund and a handful of activiely-managed funds. My question is: why? What incentives do plan sponsors have to keep their plans' investment selections so small?

My monkey brain intuition would tell me that if anything, a large pool of people participating in an employer-sponsored retirement plan should make it *cheaper* than an IRA to offer a large investment selection.

investing|Learning - Most of my retirement eggs are in SGENX|"I hope this post is appropriate as I’m currently trying to figure out my investment finances. I did search the sub for this ticker but almost everything that could be valuable is about seven years old and I don’t know if that information is still relevant.

I’ve recently been put into an unexpected financial position that doesn’t allow me to contribute much to my retirement account anymore. I’ve been putting money into sgenx for my Roth for close to ten years now on the advice of my previous employer’s financial guy. Over the past five I’ve noticed that it just wasn’t accumulating as much as I’d thought it would based on initial expectations, and I unfortunately don’t have the original paperwork on the outlook. I didn’t look into it much and assumed it would get better based on time. Time in the market, right? If I could retire at 60 or 65 like I’d planned, I doubt I’d have any questions, but since I’m essentially retired ten years earlier than expected I’ve had to do a deep dive on my financial outlook.

I’ve been looking around various sites to get more information on this fund, and Seeking Alpha has it underperforming the S&amp;P 500 by a significant margin. I’d thought the rate of return would be at least that, but it seems like I could have just put the money into a savings account and have the same return. I did find a post here from four years ago that talked about how to separate your contributions versus what was earned and I plan on doing that tomorrow, if I can based on the limited data offered on my account, but can anyone offer an opinion on this? I’m not sure if comparing this to the S&amp;P is appropriate, for starters. I’ve also talked to more than one advisor since my finances changed, and have basically got a “good luck with a HYSA” answer. Which I’m fine with if that’s the only alternative, but I’m not convinced it is. I’m not interested in heavy speculation, of course, but something to give me a little more hope.

Hi all, US Tax Question. Would love some feedback. 

Let's assume I wrote ATM call option on a stock which I owned for more than a year, and just before expiration the option is deep in the money. 

Isn't it always better to buy back the option before expiry than letting it be assigned?

From a tax perspective, if I buy back the option I will record a tax loss on the option which will be around the difference between the underlying price and the strike. 

This loss will provide a short term tax shield. 
I can then sell the stock at current price, which will generate a long term capital gain. 

This seems better than holding to maturity, which would mean that the premium received when the option was sold would be taxed as short term gains and there will be smaller long term capital gain on the assigned asset.

Can I max my Roth IRA out or do I need to lessen it based of how much goes into my Roth 401(k)? Specifically, I have a part time/seasonal job that I have a Roth 401(k) with. In 2023, $2192 was contributed to my Roth 401(k) (combined by me and my employer). Does that impact the limit of what I can contribute to my Roth IRA?"|0.65|t3_188dqwn|1701442302.0

I max out my HSA for the company match, I do not use an FSA. We may try to have a kid in the next year, so I guess I'll have more costs for hospital visits, childcare, and something called a dependent care FSA. **What sort of investments did y'all do when you had a kid? 529s or FSAs?**  
I am married but usually my spouse and I handle finances pretty separately. We did try to file our taxes together last year, but we do have individual accounts for the most part. Not sure if relevant but it does work for us.   
We want to buy a house in 3 years based on our life plan right now and when we'll need one. I don't think we'll buy one earlier than 2.5 years from now. We do have downpayment money right now. We'll also be working for the duration of the time so hopefully that downpayment money will grow. **My question is should we invest that money into a taxable brokerage account right now?** If so, I was considering VTI or VOO which is an ETF which I am hoping I can purchase using the Fidelity platform. The idea would be that if we did not make enough to cover a downpayment in 3 years of 2 incomes, we would tap into the investments for some money.

""VESTING

Vesting refers to the amount of money you have in the Plan that you have a non-forfeitable right to receive. You may be required to work a certain amount of time to earn certain contributions to the Plan. Please see your SPD section titled ""Vesting"" for more information about vesting and how it is calculated.

Do I need to work a certain amount of time to keep my elective deferrals and safe harbor matching contributions?

No, you will always be immediately 100% vested in your elective deferrals and safe harbor matching contributions.

Do I need to work a certain amount of time to keep my non-elective contributions? 

Yes, your non-elective contributions will vest as specified below:

Less than One year of vesting service - 0%
One year but less than two years of vesting service -20%
Two years but less than three years of vesting service -40%
Three years but less than four years of vesting service -60% Four years but less than five years of vesting service - 80%

In any case, I keep getting mail about their Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  What I don't understand is that they have significant cash on hand and aren't in the red--their assets more than cover their liabilities, and my understanding is that if they were to liquidate, all the shareholders would actually receive some amount of money as the company, after paying it's debts.

1) Why would a company file bankruptcy when they have more assets than liabilities?

2) Based on the current proposed sale, what will I receive as a common stock holder?

This is really just an intellectual exercise.  I'm guessing if they did actually liquidate the company and split the proceeds amongst all shareholders, I'd be lucky to get $10.  But the cynic in me thinks that having this bankruptcy proceeding allows them to transfer the company to a new owner without any of the stockholders actually getting what the company is worth had they just sold everything and walked away!  However, readin ghte court documents doesn't seem to lend any more clarity to the situation other than I'm a class 7 holder and the sale price is $10MM which seems very low given that the Schedule of Assets and liabilities indicated $151MM assets, and $17MM in Liabilities...

investing|Family office moves money out of stock and into private markets|"Saw this article today on CNBC and found it interesting as far as investing “like the pros” for 2024 and beyond. 

KEY POINTS from article: 
- Family offices now have more of their money invested in private markets than the public stock market — even as the market rallies.

- The new survey results underscore a sweeping shift in the investment practices of family offices, the private investing arms of families with assets typically of $100 million or more.

- Along with private markets, family offices are also showing increasing interest in alternative assets, including real estate and commodities.


RE makes up the largest chunk of “alternatives”  and is the largest allocation overall. RE and Private Debt were the two highest returning asset classes in 2022.

investing|Short term bond funds as hedges to USD/EU exchange?|I have USD cash equivalent (MM, treasuries, CD) that I'm planning to use to buy some properties in EU in the next 1-2 years. I did not want to convert all of them to EU because I cannot leave too much money in my EU account (protection is limited to 100k only) and also would not generate any interests. I was thinking at what options I have to edge me from large swings of USD/EU exchange. Investing them in stock is not an option due to the very short time horizon. I was observing that part of the exchange fluctuations depend on the interest rate differential expectations. So I was wondering if it makes sense to move some of these money to short term bond funds. The rationale is that if interest rates go down in US the USD will loose against EU but I would recover this from the increase of the fund. Viceversa, if they go up I would recover the loss of the bond with the more favorable exchange. Does this make sense? Or do you have any other hedge idea to consider?|0.67|t3_187q7iy|1701370947.0

I am looking to start a career in Financial planning and was looking at Model Portfolios (came across this in my CFI course). 

My first question is, do firms (like Blackrock) that provide model portfolios provide asset allocation and the basket of securities that go into the portfolio, and I as the FP would have to buy those securities for my client? or would I give them the funds and they would manage it on my behalf.

If I am managing it, what happens if there is a change in portfolio allocation? Do I get updated and have to make the changes manually?

investing|Another “What Should I Do? Post, So Sorry|"Please forgive me for making another one of these posts but I tried researching this subreddit and got even more confused. 

Started my first “big boy” job recently and was offered a 401k match. I haven’t thought much about retirement until now, and at 25+ I’m way behind the curve. 

I making sub 60k in salary. Single male, with hopes of buying a house within 4 years *fingers crossed* I’m banking on the fact that I’m in a industry that can double my salary in that time span (If I work smart and get lucky). I want to ideally retire at 55 (slightly delusional) and live in another country in retirement. 

Ok on to the problem at hand. I did some basic research before coming here and was pretty sold on the idea of a Roth 401k. Give Uncle Sam his money now, and pay no tax in retirement. But then I came across some posts in this subreddit and saw opinions of getting a tax break now and paying it in retirement because you may be in a lower tax bracket then than you would be now while working. Solid point. Someone also pointed out the fact that I could die before retirement and not had paid any taxes lol which is a great point as well. 

Anyway, I say all that to say, I’m a very confused individual at the minute and looking for some solid advice from anyone willing to share. 

Roth or Traditional? Both? 

What do I even invest that in? Stick with a Target Date Fund until I get a better understanding of other options? I assume I can change my investment plans in the future. And if I go with Target Date fund, I assume I’ll have to set it when I turn 60 given I wont get access to it until 59.5? 

Again, I know you all see these posts quite often. I tried reading some of them before making this post but I didn’t see much that clearly answered my questions given the situation I am in. So I would definitely appreciate any helpful advice.

His wealth of knowledge and common sense was greater and exceeded the utility of that which most tertiary institutions teach us these days, consistent with his criticism of modern day universities run by idiots. 

He studied mathematics, was a metrologist, turned top knotch businessman, using methods and principals he always claimed were elementary. Buy good businesses at fair prices, not fair businesses at good prices.

Investing has a lot more to do with conscientiousness, emotionally stability and risk tolerance than brains. Buy when there's blood on the streets. Not, when a house will get a tulip.

He was Warren Buffett's right hand man, and his approach to life, investing and writing speaks volumes about how life doesn't need to complex. Infact it seems to me, very very smart people make life simple, communicate simple and follow simple principles. 

When financial institutions try to make things as complex a possible, we get events like the GFC, an entire asset class propped up by actuarial valuations no one actually understands.

Recently I've taken to selling chunks of my holdings whenever I see a pretty big increase weekly or daily (usually 3% or more), and increasing my holdings when I see a similar large downturn, especially with stocks I'm intending to go long on. I find that regardless of whether I profit from the arrangement or not in the short term, I do walk away with more shares in my in investment than I had before with the same initial investment, which in the long term seems to me like a worthwhile little optimization to make, especially when it comes to shares that pay dividends. I can often scoop up an extra fifth of a share at a time in the process. Even if the share continues to increase after I sell it, I find this fine given that I still have a considerable amount held in it, so in the event it won't make it down to a lower price for me to scoop up extra fractionals, I can just put it towards other investments instead. 

This seems to piss off both of my sets of investor friends, whether long term or short term. My short term minded friends hate it because it cuts into short term profits by selling off stock that is currently increasing, and my long term minded friends hate it because of it how it tries to time the market, and I should just let the shares collect their dividends instead.

investing|401k Insights and Advice - Changing companies, what happens to my current 401k plan if new employer does not offer 401k currently?|"As title states: The brand I work for was just acquired by a new parent company that does not currently offer a 401k plan. At the previous company, we had a 401k plan through Vestwell, and I am invested in a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund (2055). 

What happens to this account now that I have transitioned to the new company? Is it just stagnant until the new employer eventually, if ever, offers a 401k plan and I can roll it over? Will the money held in Vanguard continue to rise and fall with the market? Can I roll it over myself into a Roth account to continue contributions on my own?

Really looking for any and all advice that can be offered here. Thank you.

Based on that information is there any reason you can think of why there is such a large discrepancy in the rate of return?
What I don't really understand is the bulk of the money was already in there and should have been getting the same returns as the fund.

___
 
I had a Roth 401k rolled over into a brand new Roth IRA in December of 2019. I know that there is a 5 year rule, but to my understanding, this is based on tax years. So it would be January 1 of 2019 - January 1 of 2024, correct? After 1/1/24, the five year rule has been satisfied? 

___
I also know that I am able to withdrawal my contributions, not earnings, before 5 years and not face tax or penalties. Since the Roth IRA was completely started from a Roth 401k rollover, do I need to go back and see what were my total contributions to the original ROTH 401K? Or does the entire rollover fall under the contribution umbrella? I suppose my question falls under, how do I determine what counts as contributions vs earnings? I can easily tell me new earnings because I can see the original rollover deposit. But do I need to go back and see what market gains the Roth 401k had before rollover to determine how much I could theoretically withdrawal without tax or penalties?"|0.67|t3_186ehkn|1701225301.0
investing|Robinhood Gold = Free Money?|"Robinhood Gold Membership = Free Money?

It’s been a while since anyone has posted about this subject and wanted to see what people think about it now. I am considering lump summing in January, but am not sure if this is a good idea.

Overview:  $5/month for Membership

3% IRA match (Must hold gold membership for a year) + (Hold IRA for minimum 5 years)

$1000 0% Margin Funds (Theoretically put this into 4.9% APY then pay back $1000?)

1% Transfers for IRA’s and 401k’s

4.9% APY (I know T-Bills are better, I currently use them)

So the math= 

$5 x 12 = $60/yr

$1000 in 4.9% APY = $49 when you must pay back $1000. This essentially means your membership is $11 until rates lower back down

If IRA contribution limit is $7000 next year, this means they will match you $210 of TAX ADVANTAGED money. Having this compound over the years will be huge. (if your time horizon allows.

In conclusion, is this a good idea? or should I stick to fidelity? I won’t roll over my current IRA. I just was thinking I would put $7,000 in for at least 5 years or until/if they get rid of the 3% match. Thoughts?"|0.38|t3_186bup9|1701218067.0

investing|Timing of Investments -- use CD's to reduce risk?|"Hello - 

I am new to this forum, so I hope I am phrasing my inquiry appropriately. I understand that this isn't the place for personal finance advice, so please feel free to answer more generally.

I am about to inherit a significant sum, and plan to invest it in boring index funds (either an S&amp;P index fund or VUG), and just leave it there until I retire in 20 or 25 years.

From my reading on the topic, I understand that it is basically impossible for laymen like me to time the market correctly.

So what I'm thinking is the following. Throw the funds into 3 or 6 month CD's (currently 5%+ APR), invest 10 percent or so of the total when the CD's mature, and then roll the rest of it over. Repeat for 5 or 6 years until it's all in the market.

The CD would provide a small return, while reducing risk that I am accidentally investing at a market high.

Is this market timing problem enough of a worry to bother with such an elaborate process? 

Or is missing out on 4-5 years of growth for those later investments a bigger risk?

Thanks for your thoughts."|0.71|t3_1858tvf|1701107235.0

investing|Pay Off House or Invest in S&amp;P|"Hello Everyone. I would love your opinion on this dilemma I am having and how to think about it. 

I am 29 years ears old and make $475,000 a year. I bought a $700,000 home 6 months ago and so far I paid 40% of it off. 

My dilemma is that I have been indecisive about allocating the money either between paying off the house or investing in the S&amp;P500. 

Currently, I allocate all my investment money, minus the 401K, into paying off the house. I will have it paid off in 1.5 years from now if I continue to do that. My reasoning behind being aggressive with paying it down is that I don’t want to pay too much interest, my loan of $425,000 is at 5.5% interest.

Since I allocate most of my investment money into the house to get away from too much interest, I am also missing out on the potential gain from investing aggressively into the S&amp;P500. It’s up like 20% this year. I was thinking to divide the payments 50% in the house + 50% in the S&amp;P but the idea that I can pay less interest slower if I do that hurts my head. On the other hand since I’m paying almost 100% of my investment money into the house it’s making me miss out on the S&amp;P 500 gains. 

How should so approach this?

I max out my 401K every year and so far I have close to $150,000. 

Here are a summary of the stats:
-Age: 29 
-Gross Yearly Income: $475,000 
-Net Monthly Income: $23,750 
-401K Value So Far: $150,000
-Student Loans Debt: $100,000 (Paying Off Slowly) 
-Mortgage Loan Remaining: $385,000 
-Mortgage Monthly Payment: $2415 (Includes P+I) 
-Net Worth: $315,000 (home equity) + $150,000 (401k) - Student Loans = $365,000 (not counting the mortgage)"|0.35|t3_184viut|1701062939.0

I'd like to push my cost basis down to $2.50 so I can start getting out above $5. (I know a bunch of shorts get margin called around $5. Someone shorting the stock telegraphed his margin call point on the WeWork sub. Once he gets margin called price should climb fast from the lack of shares available to trade) The trading restriction should be removed once they file their 10-Q. But, price will be higher than it is now. 

When I called up Fidelity the guy put me on hold and came back to tell me I cannot buy the stock. Despite, retail being frozen out of the market the price is higher than expected. I have a feeling people with access to the Expert Market know something, and they're defending a price floor. 

The short thesis might be right. However, the trade is crowded and their time frame is wrong. Even with the collapse of Luna / UST the shorts were largely liquidated before price went to zero. 

I want to buy as much WeWork as reasonable, sell 75% in the coming short squeeze and keep 25% in case of a miracle. Their competitor Regus had shareholders survive a similar situation during Dotcom. They at least broke even after the British subsidiary bailed out the American branch. It sounds like businesses in the co-working space frequently file bankruptcy to renegotiate leases with landlords during economic decline, and share holders survive more often than other businesses. Regus has done it a few times. (at least twice) I do not know if share holders survive every time. 

My position is relatively small. How do I gain access to the Expert Markets? Should I just call up Fidelity and ask if I can place the order over the phone? Should their customer support rep be able to tell me how my account can gain access?"|0.3|t3_184lw5o|1701035290.0

investing|"Is there anything to stop an ETF from becoming ""too overvalued""?"|"Since ETFs are easy to buy and have super low fees, they are an attractive option for people.  If I have $1000 and want to easy access to cheap, diversified stocks, I can buy any number of S&amp;P500 or total market ETFs in a couple clicks.  I'll use ticker SPY for this example.

If enough people do this, if would seem like the price could be driven up, beyond (and eventually, far beyond) the price of the underlying assets.  I spendy $1000 today, and looking at the info page on my broker, I am roughly entitled to $70 of Apple, $65 of Amazon, on down the line until I have $0.002 of some other company, all totalling $1000.  Someone else comes along and buys SPY, buy since I've bought the shares I did, they end spending $1000.45 on the next available shares.

If a few million people do this, and people aren't willing to sell SPY at the same price, theoretically, you could see the lowest shares available going up, say to $1200 for the same assets... despite the underlying shares only having moved a little.

At some point, I'd think it could be a problem.  Even if people are just overpaying a few percent.

We were almost homeless and now are making money again, it is just taking time to pull ourselves out of this mess.

We have no family or friends we can turn to for loans, etc, and we have already gotten in debt by several thousand dollars, actually it isnt anything we can't pay off once things get straightened out again.

We were with a business for 16 years together and watched it grow from profits of about $3,000/mo to $75,000/month sometimes.  We were mostly responsible for these profits increases.

Essentially when you are a member of a broker, their search engine is usually pretty crap - i.e. normally you would use the internet to find the perfect financial product first (whether that's a stock, a fund or an ETF) and then go to your broker's site to actually buy it.

investing|Cryptocurrencies - the Greater Fool Theory on Steroids|"Suppose you are holding a casino token with a redemption value of $100. You don't feel like going to the casino to redeem it, so you offer it to your friend - for $1,000. At such an offer, the friend laughs and responds: ""good joke"". He continues, ""I offer you $80 because I have the cost of going to the casino, and after the casino redeems it, I will earn a couple of bucks"". But now let's assume that you hold a digital token - Bitcoin. It has no redemption value because its issuer Satoshi Nakamoto does not redeem it. However, you ask $35,000 for it. Instead of telling you ""good joke"", your friend gives you that amount without a question.

Although in some normal times the scenario from the second example would be like a story from another dimension, we live in times where that scenario is realistic. People today pay enormous amounts of money for non-redeemable digital tokens called cryptocurrencies. There is a mania of mass buying and pumping up the prices of something that is completely worthless.

In history, a similar example of market mania was tulip one. But it was not so extreme because tulips have at least small intrinsic value. At the height of that mania, people paid for them in the equivalent of houses. With cryptocurrencies, like that Bitcoin, people are currently paying the equivalent of new cars for one crypto unit, even though that unit has neither intrinsic nor redemption value. Thus, cryptocurrency purchases are completely irrational. They are the unprecedented example of the Greater Fool theory - people buy something completely worthless in the hope that tomorrow they will sell it to a ""greater fool"".

To rationalize such irrational purchases, people have come up with all kinds of theories. The most frequently repeated is the one that goes like this: ""the value of a cryptocurrency is what people agree on."" According to this theory, that casino token with a redemption value of $100 would be ""worth"" $1,000 if your friend took the joke seriously and paid you $1,000. If he paid $10,000, that would be the ""value"" of the token. Such a theory is clearly flawed. The value of the token is not in the agreement between you and your friend, but in the simple fact that its issuer redeems it for $100. Whatever price you agree on, its value will remain the same.

The next frequently used theory goes like this: ""fiat as well"". According to that theory, crypto currencies are similar to fiat currencies. That is, the units in your crypto wallet are just like the units in your bank account or on your banknote. Not only that, but they are ""better"". Because the second are managed by selfish and evil banks, while the first by a decentralized network of computers. That theory is flawed as well. Namely, unlike crypto units, fiat units have a redemption value. For example, if your friend has a bank loan, and the bank has a lien on his house, the bank will redeem fiat units for reducing his debt and ultimately releasing the lien. Given the fact that fiat units are issued as debt - loan one in the case of companies and individuals and bond one in the case of the governments, their issuers - commercial and central banks, redeem them for reducing or closing that debt and releasing liens on movable and immovable property.

On the other hand, crypto units are not issued as debt. Rather, as numbers. First, a crypto author imagines a number - 21 million in the case of Bitcoin. Then he writes a protocol for assigning units and subunits of that number to online addresses. And that's it. There is no redemption of the units by that author, which would give them some redemption value. The units are just put on the market and go from one buyer to another on the principles of the Greater Fool theory.

So what crypto authors are doing is like when children are playing bank by writing numbers on pieces of paper and use that as ""money"", as ""monetary units"". Cryptocurrencies are the digital version of such child's play. Crypto authors are playing bank by simulating bank deposits with crypto units. People have taken the game seriously and are maniacally buying the units, pumping prices to the sky. It is the example of the Greater Fool theory in an extreme that has never been seen in human history. Time will tell how long this mania will last and how it will end."|0.44|t3_1846961|1700987356.0

I mostly discussed how disastrous the Monsanto acquisition was.

To sum it up 2023 was a shit year for Bayer on the stock market with lots of headwinds. There was some good news, but it couldn't compensate. But first, the data (this time in a table):

&amp;#x200B;

|Year|Market Cap (B EUR, approx)|Sales (M EUR)|Net Debt (M EUR)|Free Cash FLow (M EUR)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2018|64|36742|35679|4652|
|2019|69|43545|34068|4214|
|2020|47|41400|30045|1343|
|2021|44|44081|33137|1415|
|2022|54|50739|31809|3111|
|2023|32|49000\*|38721 (Q3)|0\*|

\*=Forecast

In this table we can see why 2023 was not a good year. Debt rose, on the backdrop of higher interest rates. To be fair the Q3/2022 Debt was 36B. Free cash flow is forecast to be 0, which for a company with 50ish Billion Dollars in annual sales is a terrible outcome - and the reason why I reduced my position in BAYRY this summer.

Market cap gradually decreased in 2023 until taking a big hit in November when a pivotal study involving potential blockbuster Asundexian got the axe. Legal woes are ongoing with no end in sight, with anyone and their dog still suing now ""foreign"" Monsanto and juries wielding big sticks when assigning punitive damages. There are also shared headwinds for the pharmaceutical sector overall, with rich countries seeking to cut medical spending post-pandemic.

The good news? Approval for glyphosate was renewed for 10y in the EU, R&amp;D spending is healthy, and the company is led by someone who is not tied to the disastrous Monsanto acquisition from 2018. The latter point is probably the most relevant for investors. Bill Anderson represents a much overdue change in leadership. He is aiming to streamline management and is willing to break up the company for value. In light of recent events the necessity for action should be clear and Bill is likely to get the ball rolling.

In summary: BAYRY is a riskier stock than it was 1 year ago. It's not all doom and gloom, but the change in leadership should have taken place years ago, so there is some catching up to do."|0.79|t3_183tr88|1700946961.0

I've used it for a month and I'd say it's ... Okay. Definitely overwhelming for novices (e.g. having to use limit orders during extended hours trading, over 20 different rows of numbers in the ""balance"" tab for one account, etc) 

I recently mentioned it to some younger friends of mine, and they're really interested in investing for the first time. Their employers do not offer 401k. The problem is, I can't really recommend E*Trade to them for a few reasons (several of which may make me switch myself). Basically, it's an issue of liquidity. 

Here are some of the concerns:

* Fractional Share Trading: This limits us to **Fidelity**, **Interactive Brokers**, and a few others. Probably my biggest gripe with E*Trade.
* Easy Cash: What are they supposed to do if it's Sunday and they need a $5000 for an emergency that can't be paid via credit card? I presume since it's outside of extended hours, no broker will let you sell, but are there any that will credit you early? And let you withdraw from an ATM and/or instantly move it to a checking account? What do you all do in such a situation? Is there no one that has both checking accounts and fractional share trading? Also, they have to pay their landlords with a check each month.
* In-Your-Face Tax Bill: I've explained capital gains tax to them and that dividends are regular income, but it would nice if the website and/or app made the upcoming tax bill extremely visible.

Even though we had 2 quarters of negative GDP, and a 30% correction with Bitcoin dropping 80% and the ""Magnificent 7"" being hit 40-60%

The Magnificent 7 had a great recovery even with rate hikes, which makes sense as they have money while small caps do not - but the fact we are nearing all time highs in the S&amp;P 500 makes one wonder if this is too good to be true since rates are still over 5%, the yield curve has been inverted what seems like forever, and the political banter behind policy - which is kind of silly as both parties got us in the mess in terms of National Debt.

All this is my analysis. I'm going YOLO short TQQQ in January.

I'm thinking we have a crash in January 2024 - it may be a mirror of 2022 with a 30% crash retesting the 3480 zone. And in fact, it may have nothing to do with Fed decisions as it may be more ""futures"" driven. Everyone expects rate cuts at the end of a market cycle, and if the Fed does not give the market what the market wants, the market will do the work for them forcing them to cut rates to remain solvant. If the larger bond market rates fall but Fed rates remain high, Fed has to lower rates to stay competitive.

 If the S&amp;P 500 breaks 2022 lows, I think it could fall to 2018 levels which would act as support from the last market cycle end / pivot."|0.43|t3_182i15h|1700795043.0

I started out by selecting FID Freedom 2055 (FDEEX) blended investment. However, I am looking to add one other option in stock investments.

investing|Thoughts on PayPal (PYPL) - A few of my thoughts|"Disclaimer: I own PayPal for the past 6 months, average price of 62 dollars, 5000 holdings. 

PayPal performance has been horrible in whatever chart we take a look at. YTD, monthly, 6 months...heck, it is trading equal or even lower to its share price back in 2017. What do you guys think about this stock? Is it a buy? Sell? 

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts 

\- Although competition is a concern, PayPal is still a solid brand name. Transactional volume still growing. 

\- The drop in user count YoY might not be a direct effect of increased competition, but pandemic online shopping has died down.

\- FCF is strong, buybacks &amp; low forward PE.

\- Possible growth stories with Braintree, PayPal buy now pay later &amp; Venmo.

\- New CEO focused on improving profit margins. 

\- High single digit growth

\-Decent network effects on both sides

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't think it is the best company in the world, like MSFT, AAPL just to name a few. However, at such prices, I believe it is a good deal for what it is worth. Looking forward to reading some of your thoughts! "|0.59|t3_1824r15|1700756396.0
investing|Thoughts on transferring “all” of my savings into equities|"Currently I have about $130,000 in cash in a high-yield savings account yielding over 5%. I have about $50,000 in VT. Given that it is likely interest rates will be cut in 2024 thus yielding lower savings rate and likely increasing stock gains,should I allocate the vast majority of my savings into equities?

  I may possibly want to buy a house within the next couple of years? Looking into the future, I would be devastated if my cash was yielding next to nothing while stocks have increased significantly.

investing|Suitability assessment for Self-Directed Accounts|"I know someone in compliance and on occasion discussion of wacky finance stuff comes up.  They make seemingly silly statements that may be letter of the law true but no where near reality.  For example, GameStop.  They claim, ‘none of those trades should have been happening since they wouldn’t have passed a suitability review’.

Their position is that no broker should have been ok’ing long positions in GME for ‘retail’ people. I find this super confusing because how much scrutiny do brokers apply to self-directed trades.  Even in the 90s i made a couple of (in hindsight) unsuitable self-directed trades. This person works more in wealth management so it makes a ton of sense that their company would never be recommending clients trade in GME but the claim that self-directed accounts should have been blocked from making trades in GME seems to not reflect reality.

Is this person’s interpretation misdirected or is it aligned with the rules but the SEC just doesn’t hold brokerages accountable for reviewing self-directed suitability?"|0.9|t3_1824l8w|1700755959.0
investing|can I just use a regular brokerage like Schwab if I won the lottery and had 100mil to invest?|I’m a simple guy, if I won $105 million in the lottery I would probably buy a 500k-1.5 million dollar house in the suburbs of a major city in a gated community and 2-3 30k-100k dollar cars paid off. Probably a couple small things as well such as giving money to family included within that 5 million.  That would leave me with over 100 million to invest. I like investing and like doing it myself, I wouldn’t want financial advisors having a say or meddling with what I’m doing. Can I just hypothetically just put it in Schwab and put 90-95% in ETF’s and the other 5-10% in volatile stocks that I can trade and invest casually and check it on my app every now and then and just take out money normally if I need it? I was thinking if this is how minimalist tech bros do it, the ones who have successfully exited from a company for millions of dollars who just want to live a relaxed lifestyle do it? ideally I would want to have 1 residence and 2-3 cars paid off  and have a couple hundred K in a bank account and live my life using a high limit credit card and then only selling stock when I need to replenish my checking accounts. The only money I see myself spending would be for traveling and experiences. Essentially just a couple months out of the year living like a digital nomad and then the rest at my house. The only tax I see myself having to worry about would be property taxes and then capital gains every couple years because I would plan on selling rarely. Just taking out enough to have to last me a couple years in my personal accounts and then selling again when those accounts start getting low. Having a family office and a group of financial advisors to constantly deal with seems annoying and I would rather just do it myself? Thoughts? I wouldn’t mind having a team of advisors if it’s one of those things where we just check up on the portfolio every couple months and also would it be better to have it invested through a holding company or in personal accounts?|0.82|t3_18236sx|1700752105.0

investing|Money Market Funds vs. T-Bills for Short-term?|"**I have $19k that I'd like to park for short-term (8 months - 2 years) for a personal need and Money Market Funds seem to be right option for me vs. dividends etc.** 
This would be my emergency fund. (Minus liquid for 3-5 months that I keep in bank account)

I'd prefer them to be distributing (my understanding being interest paid out periodically) but fine if they're accumulating as well.

I already have some investments in ETFs. Interest rates are atrocious in Dubai and I'd rather not keep the funds here anyway.

Most of the information I come across is aimed at US investors followed by the Europeans. 

I might be in a unique situation as: 

a) There are no personal/federal taxes in the UAE.

b) USD:AED are pegged so there should not be currency risk. Importantly, I'd like to keep my investments in the USD anyhow as I am more bullish on it than other global currencies.


In this case, which money market fund would you recommend? 
I am unable to buy ever so popular **SPRXX, SPAXX, FDLXX** -- IBKR gives me a 'Residency restriction' for them. 

- My options seem to be US T-Bills for 1 year or **IB01** (Expense Ratio: 0.07%, Yield: 5.30%), however I feel I might be missing something here?

- What happens if interest rates go down within 1-2 year while I am holding them?

investing|Fidelity won't let me buy WeWork shares since I'm not an expert.|"So, speculation is going on on Twitter about WeWork possibly being bailed out. So, people have been buying WeWork since the price action and short interest make it look like the stock could squeeze in the short term. 

From their recent filings it looks like the bankruptcy fillings were most likely more of a strategic move to discharge some debt, and drop landlords. So, shareholders are talking about suing to keep their shares. There was a filing in the bankruptcy filing about SoftBank getting to keep their shares, while everyone else holding the same type of share has their shares declared worthless.  


So, from the shareholder lawsuit, and rumors over a bailout there's a potential squeeze. The short interest is also really high currently. But, that won't happen if retail investors cannot buy shares. At least, not to the AMC / GME level. If a short squeeze does happen there's also the potential for SoftBank to pull WeWork out of bankruptcy by selling some shares. They were within a quarter or two of being break even, prior to the filing. 

Currently, I'm only allowed to sell my shares. I would like to buy more to lower my cost basis, and increase my odds of getting out at break even on a pump, or earn more from a squeeze. So, how do I get expert status? Do I have to be an accredited investor? What type of account do I need for that?

As a related tangent, there's a stock going for 0.007 that I think has potential to come back. Is there any broker that is more friendly towards allowing retail to buy moonshots like that?
